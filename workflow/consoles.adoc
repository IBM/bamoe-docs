== Management Console

The Management Console is a user interface for viewing the state of all available {PRODUCT_SHORT} services and managing process instances:

.Management Console
image::runtime-services-modeling/kogito-management-console.png[Image of Kogito Management Console]

You can use the Management Console to view process, subprocess, and node instance details, abort process instances, and view domain-specific process data.

The Management Console requires your {PRODUCT_SHORT} services to use the following {PRODUCT_SHORT} components:

* *{PRODUCT_SHORT} Data Index Service*: Enables the Management Console to access stored events related to processes and domain data from your {PRODUCT_SHORT} services. The {PRODUCT_SHORT} Data Index Service requires Infinispan or MongoDB persistence and Apache Kafka messaging for your {PRODUCT_SHORT} service.
//For more information about the Data Index Service, see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#con-data-index-service_kogito-configuring[_{CONFIGURING_KOGITO}_].
* *{PRODUCT_SHORT} process management add-on*: Enables the Management Console to interact with the process data from your {PRODUCT_SHORT} services through the add-on REST endpoint `/management/processes`.
If you do not enable this add-on for your {PRODUCT_SHORT} service, the Management Console provides read-only access to your service data without the ability to modify instances, such as aborting process instances.
//For more information about the process management add-on, see xref:../workflow/deploying-process-services.html[].

To visualize the process instance execution path at the management console, add the following add-on:

* *{PRODUCT_SHORT} process SVG add-on*: Enables the process SVG diagram to visualize the process instance execution path.
If this add-on is not enabled for your {PRODUCT_SHORT} service, the management console does not display the diagram panel.
//For more information about the process SVG add-on, see xref:con-bpmn-process-svg-addon_kogito-developing-process-services[].

=== Using the Management Console to manage process instances

You can use the Management Console to view and manage process instance details from your {PRODUCT_SHORT} services.
You can run the Management Console for local {PRODUCT_SHORT} services or add it to your {PRODUCT_SHORT} infrastructure on {OPENSHIFT}.

.Prerequisites
* A {PRODUCT_SHORT} Data Index Service instance is configured and running for your {PRODUCT_SHORT} service.
The Data Index Service enables the Management Console to access stored process data.
The Data Index Service requires Infinispan or MongoDB persistence and Apache Kafka messaging for your {PRODUCT_SHORT} service.
//For information about the Data Index Service, see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#con-data-index-service_kogito-configuring[_{CONFIGURING_KOGITO}_].
* The `pom.xml` file of your {PRODUCT_SHORT} project contains the following dependency for the process management add-on.
This add-on enables the Management Console to interact with the process data through the add-on REST endpoint `/management/processes`.

=== Enabling Management Console security

For security, the Management Console relies on https://www.keycloak.org/about.html[Keycloak] solution for authentication.
Once a user is authenticated, Management Console uses bearer tokens to communicate with other {PRODUCT_SHORT} services.

IMPORTANT: By default, To enable security it is required to run Management Console in "PROD" mode.

.Prerequisites
* You have a https://www.keycloak.org/about.html[Keycloak] server running.

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you log in to the Keycloak administration console, navigate to the respective client configuration, and add correct URLs of different applications.
For easier configuration, you can add `*`  in the *Web Origins*, however, it can cause security issues.
You can also add the origin URLs as a parameter to the *Web Origins*, which can prevent the issues related to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
