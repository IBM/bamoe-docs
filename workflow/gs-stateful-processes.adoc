This section describes how to configure a stateful process project in {PRODUCT_SHORT}. It refers to the sample project demonstrating a stateful hiring process service: xref:../getting-started/examples.html[jbpm-compact-architecture-example], which drives a candidate through different interviews to the successful hiring decision. The example includes the use of DMN decisions to generate the candidate offer and timers to skip user tasks. 

== Creating and configuring a stateful process

In this section we will focus on how to build and configure the Hiring process in Canvas.

For information on setting up Canvas see xref:../installation/canvas.adoc[Canvas installation]

=== Create Process Variables

. Open Canvas with workflow elements.

. Click anywhere in the canvas and then click on the properties tab to access the properties panel.
+
.Canvas for workflow showing properties
image::wf-tutorial/canvas-wf-1.png[Canvas for workflow showing properties]

. Set the following properties:
 * *Name*: Provide a label for the process.
 * *ID*: Specify an identifier that will be used for endpoints.
 * *Description*: Write a detailed description of the process.
. To add input variables:
 * Click the plus button to add a new variable.
 * Set the variable name and data type. 
 ** _Name_ is the ID and name of the variable which can be referenced via scripts or the input/output of activities. 
 ** Data type refers to a Java type. If you click Select Custom, the field turns into the fully qualified name of the class.

=== Define Workflow Elements

Use the following elements to define your workflow:

* *Start Event*: Green circle indicating the starting point of the workflow.
* *Intermediate Events*: Yellow circle for events that occur between the start and end points.
* *End Events*: Red circle marking the end of the workflow.
* *Activities*: Empty rectangle representing tasks or activities in the workflow.
* *Subprocess*: Rectangle with a square for subprocesses.
* *Gateways*: Diamond shape for decision points.
* *Lanes*: Checklist icon to organize tasks by roles or departments.
* *Non-executable Items*: 3D cube for items not executed within the workflow.
* *Miscellaneous*: Engine icon for other workflow components.

=== Adjust Properties and Add Process Variables

. Create a start node with a script to initialize variables:
// where does the script need to go - in UI or javascript called via UI?
+
[source,java]
----
System.out.println("New Hiring has been created for candidate: " + candidateData.getFullName());
kcontext.setVariable("hr_approval", false);
kcontext.setVariable("it_approval", false);
----
. Add an exclusive gateway for decision-making.
. Create a business rule task with specific properties and data assignments:
+
[source,java]
----
System.out.println("###################################");
System.out.println("Generated offer for candidate: " + candidateData.getFullName());
System.out.println("Job Category: " + offer.getCategory());
System.out.println("Base salary: " + offer.getSalary());
System.out.println("###################################");
----
. Create and configure human tasks and boundary events:
+
[source,java]
----
System.out.println("###################################");
System.out.println("HR Interview have been avoided after reasonable time");
System.out.println("###################################");
----
. Add scripts for various tasks and events to log important details and actions:
+
[source,java]
----
System.out.println("###################################");
System.out.println("To: " + candidateData.getEmail());
System.out.println("Subject: Congratulations you made it!");
System.out.println("Dear " + candidateData.getFullName() + ", we are happy to tell you that you've successfully went through the hiring process. You'll find the final Offer details in attached.");
System.out.println("Job Category: " + offer.getCategory());
System.out.println("Base salary: " + offer.getSalary());
System.out.println("###################################");

System.out.println("###################################");
System.out.println("Candidate " + candidateData.getFullName() + " doesn't meet the requirements for the position but we'll keep it on records for the future!");
System.out.println("###################################");
----

== Creating a new project using accelerators in Canvas
The accelerator functionality available in Canvas can be used to quickly create the required artifacts for a stateful process service. See xref:../installation/canvas.adoc[installing Canvas] for more information on setting up Canvas. 

. Open Canvas.
. Import `hiring.bpmn` (xref:hiring.bpmn.zip[sample hiring BPMN file]).
. Click *Apply accelerator* -> *Quarkus (Full)*, and on the pop-up click *Apply*.
+
.New process project with accelerator
image::wf-tutorial/1-new-process-project-with-accelerator.png[Process project with accelerator]
+
. Click "Untitled Project" and rename the project. In this example, the project 1. is named `process-service-sample`
+
.Renaming project
image::wf-tutorial/2-renaming-project.png[Renaming project]
. Download the project to your local development environment by clicking on *Share* -> *All files*. This enables you to run the project locally with BAMOE Developer tools for VS Code. 

NOTE: Users with pre-configured git authentication can synchronize the new project on git and push it to a new repository.

== Setting up the database for a stateful process project
TBD



== Running the project locally with VSCode

Following the download of your process service to your local development environment, you can unzip the project into a new folder using the following command:

`$ unzip process-service-sample.zip -d process-service-sample`

Open the project `process-service-sample` using VSCode.

When using IBM BAMOE Developer Tools extension, developers can seamlesly interact with business assets directly from the developer IDE.

.Project in VS Code
image::wf-tutorial/3-project-in-vscode.png[Project in VS Code]

Note that the project includes the process definition and the `application.properties` file with generic sample configurations:

To execute the project in the local development environment, open a new terminal in VScode and execute:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean package
----

.Opening a terminal in VS Code
image::wf-tutorial/4-new-terminal-vscode.png[Opening a terminal in VS Code]

This command should compile and package the process service into a Quarkus executable Jar file. The resulting package is the service that can later be containerized and executed on cloud platforms. The process service generated using the accelerator brings a pre-configured set of add-ons via the `pom.xml` file. You can adapt this file to meet the requirements of your service.

The first execution downloads any artifacts not yet available on the development environment
