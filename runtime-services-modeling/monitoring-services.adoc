== {PRODUCT} Operator interaction with Prometheus and Grafana

[role="_abstract"]
{PRODUCT} provides a `monitoring-prometheus-addon` add-on that enables Prometheus metrics monitoring for {PRODUCT} services and generates Grafana dashboards that consume the default metrics exported by the add-on. The {PRODUCT} Operator uses the  https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator[Prometheus Operator] to expose the metrics from your {PRODUCT} project for Prometheus to scrape. Due to this dependency, the Prometheus Operator must be installed in the same namespace as your {PRODUCT} project.

When you deploy an {PRODUCT} service that uses the `monitoring-prometheus-addon` add-on and the  Prometheus Operator is installed, the {PRODUCT} Operator creates a `ServiceMonitor` custom resource to expose the metrics for Prometheus, as shown in the following example:

.Example `ServiceMonitor` resource for Prometheus
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    app: onboarding-service
  name: onboarding-service
  namespace: kogito
spec:
  endpoints:
  - path: /metrics
    targetPort: 8080
    scheme: http
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
    - kogito
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: onboarding-service
----

You must manually configure your `Prometheus` custom resource that is managed by the Prometheus Operator to select the `ServiceMonitor` resource:

.Example `Prometheus` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  serviceAccountName: prometheus
  serviceMonitorSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: onboarding-service
----

After you configure your Prometheus resource with the `ServiceMonitor` resource, you can see the endpoint being scraped by Prometheus in the *Targets* page in the Prometheus web console:

.Targets page in Prometheus web console

The metrics exposed by the {PRODUCT} service appear in the *Graph* view:

.Graph view in Prometheus web console
image::kogito-operator-prometheus-graph.png[Image of Kogito service graph view in Prometheus]

The {PRODUCT} Operator also creates a `GrafanaDashboard` custom resource defined by the https://operatorhub.io/operator/grafana-operator[Grafana Operator] for each of the Grafana dashboards generated by the add-on. The `app` label for the dashboards is the name of the deployed {PRODUCT} service. You must set the `dashboardLabelSelector` property of the `Grafana` custom resource according to the relevant {PRODUCT} service.

.Example `Grafana` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: integreatly.org/v1alpha1
kind: Grafana
metadata:
  name: example-grafana
spec:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
  config:

      disable_signout_menu: true
    auth.anonymous:
      enabled: true
    log:
      level: warn
      mode: console
    security:
      admin_password: secret
      admin_user: root

    - matchExpressions:
        - key: app
          operator: In
          values:
            - my-kogito-application

=== Replacing {PRODUCT} services TrustStores

[role="_abstract"]
You can replace the default Java TrustStore that comes in {PRODUCT} images. Replacement of Java TrustStore is required when a given {PRODUCT} service makes HTTPS calls to services that require encrypted connections using a private https://dzone.com/articles/understanding-the-role-of-certificate-authorities[Certificate Authority (CA)].

.Prerequisites
* The Java TrustStore replaces the default one. You must add the trusted certificates to the default JKS. As an alternative, you can create a new TrustStore that consists of the required {PRODUCT} service certificates.

NOTE: Any {PRODUCT} service that is deployed in a given namespace can access the Java TrustStore if required.

To manipulate the Java TrustStore, you can use https://keystore-explorer.org/[KeyExplorer] or https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html[keytool] that consists of JDK.

.Procedure
. Create a https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configmap-secret/managing-secret-using-config-file/[Kubernetes Secret] based on the customized Java TrustStore:
+
--
.Example Kuberbetes Secret
[source]
----
$ oc create secret generic kogito-truststore --from-file=cacerts=<path to your JKS> --from-literal=keyStorePassword=<TrustStore Password>
----
--
+
You must define the secret keys as shown in the previous command. `cacerts` is used for the TrustStore file and `keyStorePassword` is used for the TrustStore password.

. Deploy the {PRODUCT} service that uses the TrustStore. For example:
+
--
.Example {PRODUCT} service deployment
[source,yaml]
----
piVersion: app.kiegroup.org/v1beta1
kind: KogitoRuntime
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  replicas: 1
  image: quay.io/my-namespace/my-service:latest
  trustStoreSecret: kogito-truststore
----

=== Enabling Prometheus metrics monitoring in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] is an open source systems monitoring toolkit that you can use with {PRODUCT} to collect and store metrics related to the execution of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) process models, business rules, and Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models. You can access the stored metrics through a REST API call to a configured application endpoint, through the Prometheus expression browser, or using a data-graphing tool such as https://grafana.com/[Grafana].

.Prerequisites
* Prometheus is installed. For information about downloading and using Prometheus, see the https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/[Prometheus documentation page].

.Procedure
. In your {PRODUCT} project, depending on the framework you are using, add one of the following dependencies to the `pom.xml` file to enable the Prometheus add-on:
+
--
.Add dependency for Prometheus Quarkus add-on
[source,xml,subs="+quotes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-monitoring-prometheus</artifactId>
  <version>__KOGITO_VERSION__</version>
</dependency>
----

By default, all stored metrics are exported to the configured monitoring module. If you want to disable certain metrics from being exported, you can set any of the following properties in the `application.properties` file of your {PRODUCT} project:

.Enable or disable specific metrics from being exported
[source]
----
kogito.monitoring.rule.useDefault=false
kogito.monitoring.process.useDefault=false
kogito.monitoring.interceptor.useDefault=false
----
--

. In the `prometheus.yaml` file of your Prometheus distribution, add the following settings in the `scrape_configs` section to configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your {PRODUCT} service:
+
--
.Example scrape configurations in `prometheus.yaml` file
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
scrape_configs:
  job_name: 'kogito-metrics'
metrics_path: /metrics
static_configs:
  - targets: ["localhost:8080"]
----

Replace the values according to your {PRODUCT} service settings.
--
. In a command terminal, navigate to your {PRODUCT} project and run the project using your preferred run mode, such as development mode:
+
--
.On Quarkus
[source]
----
mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
----

After you start your {PRODUCT} service, Prometheus begins collecting metrics and {PRODUCT} publishes the metrics to the configured REST API endpoint.
--
. To verify the metrics configuration, use a REST client or curl utility to send a `GET` request to the configured `/metrics` endpoint, such as `\http://localhost:8080/metrics` in this example:
+
--
.Example curl command to return Prometheus metrics

If the metrics are not available at the defined endpoint, review and verify the {PRODUCT} and Prometheus configurations described in this section.

You can also interact with your collected metrics and application targets in the Prometheus expression browser at `http://__HOST:PORT__/graph` and `http://__HOST:PORT__/targets`, or integrate your Prometheus data source with a data-graphing tool such as Grafana:

==== Grafana dashboards for default metrics in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
If any of the Prometheus monitoring modules are imported as dependencies in the `pom.xml` file of your {PRODUCT} project, some Grafana dashboards that use the default metrics are generated under the folder `target/classes/META-INF/resources/monitoring/dashboards/` every time you compile your {PRODUCT} service.

Two types of dashboards are exported depending on the decision model used on the endpoints:

* *Operational dashboard*: This dashboard is generated for DMN and DRL endpoints and contains the following metrics:
** Total number of requests on the endpoint
** Average number of requests per minute on the endpoint
** Quantiles on the elapsed time to evaluate the requests
** Exception details
+
.Generated operational dashboard example
image::grafana-operational-dashboard.png[Generated operational dashboard]

* *Domain-specific dashboard*: Currently this dashboard is exported only for DMN endpoints. The domain-specific dashboard contains a graph for each type of decision in the DMN model. Only the built-in types `number`, `string`, and `boolean` are currently supported.
** If the output of the decision is a `number` type, the graph contains the quantiles for that metric on a sliding window of 3 minutes.
** If the output is a `boolean` or a `string` type, the graph contains the number of occurrences for each output on a 10-minute average.
+
.Generated domain-specific dashboard example
image::grafana-domain-dashboard.png[Generated domain specific dashboard]

NOTE: Generated dashboards for BPMN resources are currently not supported.

==== Custom Grafana dashboards in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
You can add custom dashboards that are defined as `json` files in your project. For format specification and more information, see https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/json-model/[Official documentation] page.

To add custom dashboards in your {PRODUCT} project, you must follow the following conventions:

* Dashboard files must be stored in `/src/main/resources/META-INF/dashboards` directory
* dashboard file names must start with `domain-dashoboard` (for domain specific dashboards) or `operational-dashboard` (for operational dashboards)
* Dashboard file names must end with `.json`
* Dashboard file names must not conflict with the auto-generated ones
* The `title` attribute of custom dashboards must not conflict with the auto-generated attributes

Custom dashboards are available in the Grafana panel along with the auto-generated dashboards.

==== Disabling Grafana dashboards generation in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
You can disable the generation of default dashboards in Prometheus metrics monitoring using the following properties:

.Properties to disable default dashboards
[source]
----
kogito.grafana.disabled.operational.dashboards
kogito.grafana.disabled.domain.dashboards
----

.Prerequisites
* Prometheus is installed. For information about downloading and using Prometheus, see the https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/[Prometheus documentation page].

.Procedure

. To disable Grafana dashboard, add a comma-separated list of dashboard identifiers to the following properties:
+
--
.Properties to disable Grafana dashboard
[source]
----
kogito.grafana.disabled.operational.dashboards
kogito.grafana.disabled.domain.dashboards
----

The `kogito.grafana.disabled.operational.dashboards` property disables the generation of operational dashboards and `kogito.grafana.disabled.domain.dashboards` property disables the generation of domain dashboards.

For example, a project containing the following resources uses the default configuration and generates the default dashboards:

.Example project resources
[source]
----
Hello.drl
LoanEligibility.dmn
Traffic Violation.dmn
----

The following are the default generated dashboards in {PRODUCT}:

.Example default generated dashboards for a project
[cols="50%,50%", options="header"]
|===
|Dashboard type |Dashboard name

.3+|Operational
|`Hello`
|`LoanEligibility`
|`Traffic Violation`

.3+|Domain
|`Hello`
|`LoanEligibility`
|`Traffic Violation`
|===

If you use the following configuration in the `application.properties` file, the generation of `Hello` and `Traffic Violation` operational dashboards, and `LoanEligibility` domain dashboard is avoided.

.Configuration for disabling specific dashboards
----
kogito.grafana.disabled.operational.dashboards=Hello,Traffic Violation
kogito.grafana.disabled.domain.dashboards=LoanEligibility
----

.Customized generation of dashboards in {PRODUCT}
[cols="50%,50%"]
|===
|Dashboard type |Dashboard name

.1+|Operational
|`LoanEligibility`
.2+|Domain
|`Hello`
|`Traffic Violation`
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
The spaces between the dashboard identifiers are eliminated as follows:

.Example dashboard identifiers with spaces
[source]
----
Hello, Traffic Violation, LoanEligibility
----

.Example dashboard identifiers without spaces
[source]
----
"Hello"
"Traffic Violation"
"LoanEligibility"
----

However, the spaces within a dashboard identifier are maintained as follows:

.Example dashboard identifiers with spaces
[source]
----
Traffic Violation, Traffic    Violation, Tra ffic Violation
----

.Example dashboard identifiers without spaces
[source]
----
"Traffic Violation"
"Traffic    Violation"
"Tra ffic Violation"
----
