= Decisions with DMN 
IBM, KIE Community

include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of business decisions, you can use Decision Model and Notation (DMN) to model a decision service graphically. The decision requirements of a DMN decision model are determined by a decision requirements graph (DRG) that is depicted in one or more decision requirements diagrams (DRDs). A DRD can represent part or all of the overall DRG for the DMN model. DRDs trace business decisions from start to finish, with each decision node using logic defined in DMN boxed expressions such as decision tables.

{PRODUCT} provides runtime support for DMN 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 models at conformance level 3 and design support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3. You can design your DMN models with {CANVAS} or import existing DMN models into your {PRODUCT} projects for deployment and execution. Any DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models (do not contain DMN 1.3 features) that you import, open in the DMN designer, and save are converted to DMN 1.2 models.

For more information about DMN, see the Object Management Group (OMG) https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].

== Decision Model and Notation (DMN)

[role="_abstract"]
Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is a standard established by the https://www.omg.org/[Object Management Group (OMG)] for describing and modeling operational decisions. DMN defines an XML schema that enables DMN models to be shared between DMN-compliant platforms and across organizations so that business analysts and business rules developers can collaborate in designing and implementing DMN decision services. The DMN standard is similar to and can be used together with the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard for designing and modeling business processes.

For more information about the background and applications of DMN, see the OMG https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].

[id="con-dmn-conformance-levels"]
=== DMN conformance levels

[role="_abstract"]
The DMN specification defines three incremental levels of conformance in a software implementation. A product that claims compliance at one level must also be compliant with any preceding levels. For example, a conformance level 3 implementation must also include the supported components in conformance levels 1 and 2. For the formal definitions of each conformance level, see the OMG https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].

The following list summarizes the three DMN conformance levels:

Conformance level 1::
A DMN conformance level 1 implementation supports decision requirement diagrams (DRDs), decision logic, and decision tables, but decision models are not executable. Any language can be used to define the expressions, including natural, unstructured languages.

Conformance level 2::
A DMN conformance level 2 implementation includes the requirements in conformance level 1, and supports Simplified Friendly Enough Expression Language (S-FEEL) expressions and fully executable decision models.

Conformance level 3::
A DMN conformance level 3 implementation includes the requirements in conformance levels 1 and 2, and supports Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) expressions, the full set of boxed expressions, and fully executable decision models.

{PRODUCT} provides runtime support for DMN 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 models at conformance level 3 and design support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3. You can design your DMN models with {CANVAS} or import existing DMN models into your {PRODUCT} projects for deployment and execution. Any DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models (do not contain DMN 1.3 features) that you import, open in the DMN designer, and save are converted to DMN 1.2 models.

=== DMN decision requirements diagram (DRD) components

[role="_abstract"]
A decision requirements diagram (DRD) is a visual representation of your DMN model. A DRD can represent part or all of the overall decision requirements graph (DRG) for the DMN model. DRDs trace business decisions using decision nodes, business knowledge models, sources of business knowledge, input data, and decision services.

The following table summarizes the components in a DRD:

=== Rule expressions in FEEL

[role="_abstract"]
Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) is an expression language defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) DMN specification. FEEL expressions define the logic of a decision in a DMN model. FEEL is designed to facilitate both decision modeling and execution by assigning semantics to the decision model constructs. FEEL expressions in decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) occupy table cells in boxed expressions for decision nodes and business knowledge models.

For more information about FEEL in DMN, see:

* The OMG https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].
* link:https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/[DMN FEEL Handbook]

[id="ref-dmn-feel-data-types"]
==== Data types in FEEL

[role="_abstract"]
Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) supports the following data types:

* https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/#number[Numbers]
* https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/#string[Strings]
* https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/#boolean[Boolean values]
* https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/#date[Dates]
* https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/#time[Time]
* https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/#date-and-time[Date and time]
* https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/#days-and-time-duration[Days and time duration]
* https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/#years-and-month-duration[Years and months duration]
* https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/#function[Functions]
* https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/#context[Contexts]
* https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/#range-or-interval[Ranges (or intervals)]
* https://kiegroup.github.io/dmn-feel-handbook/#list[Lists]

NOTE: The DMN specification currently does not provide an explicit way of declaring a variable as a `function`, `context`, `range`, or `list`, but {PRODUCT} extends the DMN built-in types to support variables of these types.

The following list describes each data type:

Numbers::
Numbers in FEEL are based on the http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4610935/[IEEE 754-2008] Decimal 128 format, with 34 digits of precision. Internally, numbers are represented in Java as https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html[`BigDecimals`] with `MathContext DECIMAL128`. FEEL supports only one number data type, so the same type is used to represent both integers and floating
point numbers.
+
--
FEEL numbers use a dot (`.`) as a decimal separator. FEEL does not support `-INF`, `+INF`, or `NaN`. FEEL uses
`null` to represent invalid numbers.

{PRODUCT} extends the DMN specification and supports additional number notations:

* *Scientific:* You can use scientific notation with the suffix `e<exp>` or `E<exp>`. For example, `1.2e3` is the same as writing the expression `1.2*10**3`, but is a literal instead of an expression.
* *Hexadecimal:* You can use hexadecimal numbers with the prefix `0x`. For example, `0xff` is the same as the decimal number `255`. Both uppercase and lowercase letters are supported. For example, `0XFF` is the same as `0xff`.
* *Type suffixes:* You can use the type suffixes `f`, `F`, `d`, `D`, `l`, and `L`. These suffixes are ignored.
--

Strings::
Strings in FEEL are any sequence of characters delimited by double quotation marks.
+
--
.Example
----
"John Doe"
----
--

Boolean values::
FEEL uses three-valued boolean logic, so a boolean logic expression may have values `true`, `false`, or `null`.


Dates::
Date literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in `date()` function to construct date values. Date strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#date[XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes] document. The format is `"YYYY-MM-DD"` where `YYYY` is the year with four digits, `MM` is the number of the month with two digits, and `DD` is the number of the day.
+
--
Example:
----
date( "2017-06-23" )
----

Date objects have time equal to `"00:00:00"`, which is midnight. The dates are considered to be local, without a timezone.
--

Time::
Time literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in `time()` function to construct time values. Time strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#time[XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes] document. The format is `"hh:mm:ss[.uuu][(+-)hh:mm]"` where `hh` is the hour of the day (from `00` to `23`), `mm` is the minutes in the hour, and `ss` is the number of seconds in the minute. Optionally, the string may define the number of milliseconds (`uuu`) within the second and contain a positive (`+`) or negative (`-`) offset from UTC time to define its timezone. Instead of using an offset, you can use the letter `z` to represent the UTC time, which is the same as an offset of `-00:00`. If no offset is defined, the time is considered to be local.
+
--
Examples:
----
time( "04:25:12" )
time( "14:10:00+02:00" )
time( "22:35:40.345-05:00" )
time( "15:00:30z" )
----

Time values that define an offset or a timezone cannot be compared to local times that do not define an offset or a timezone.
--

Date and time::
Date and time literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in `date and time()` function to construct date and time values. Date and time strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime[XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes] document. The format is `"<date>T<time>"`, where `<date>` and `<time>` follow the prescribed XML schema formatting, conjoined by `T`.
+
--
Examples:
----
date and time( "2017-10-22T23:59:00" )
date and time( "2017-06-13T14:10:00+02:00" )
date and time( "2017-02-05T22:35:40.345-05:00" )
date and time( "2017-06-13T15:00:30z" )
----

Date and time values that define an offset or a timezone cannot be compared to local date and time values
that do not define an offset or a timezone.

IMPORTANT: If your implementation of the DMN specification does not support spaces in the XML schema, use the keyword `dateTime` as a synonym of `date and time`.

--

Days and time duration::
Days and time duration literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in `duration()` function to construct days and time duration values. Days and time duration strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration[XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes] document, but are restricted to only days, hours, minutes and seconds. Months and years are not supported.
+
--
Examples:
----
duration( "P1DT23H12M30S" )
duration( "P23D" )
duration( "PT12H" )
duration( "PT35M" )
----

IMPORTANT: If your implementation of the DMN specification does not support spaces in the XML schema, use the keyword `dayTimeDuration` as a synonym of `days and time duration`.

--

Years and months duration::
Years and months duration literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in `duration()` function to construct days and time duration values. Years and months duration strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration[XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes] document, but are restricted to only years and months. Days, hours, minutes, or seconds are not supported.
+
--
Examples:
----
duration( "P3Y5M" )
duration( "P2Y" )
duration( "P10M" )
duration( "P25M" )
----

IMPORTANT: If your implementation of the DMN specification does not support spaces in the XML schema, use the keyword `yearMonthDuration` as a synonym of `years and months duration`.

--

Functions::
FEEL has `function` literals (or anonymous functions) that you can use to create functions. The DMN specification currently does not provide an explicit way of declaring a variable as a `function`, but {PRODUCT} extends the DMN built-in types to support variables of functions.
+
--
Example:
----
function(a, b) a + b
----
In this example, the FEEL expression creates a function that adds the parameters `a` and `b` and returns the result.
--

Contexts::
FEEL has `context` literals that you can use to create contexts. A `context` in FEEL is a list of key and value pairs, similar to maps in languages like Java. The DMN specification currently does not provide an explicit way of declaring a variable as a `context`, but {PRODUCT} extends the DMN built-in types to support variables of contexts.
+
--
Example:
----
{ x : 5, y : 3 }
----
In this example, the expression creates a context with two entries, `x` and `y`, representing a coordinate in a chart.

In DMN 1.2, another way to create contexts is to create an item definition that contains the list of keys as attributes, and then declare the variable as having that item definition type.

The {PRODUCT} DMN API supports DMN `ItemDefinition` structural types in a `DMNContext` represented in two ways:

* User-defined Java type: Must be a valid JavaBeans object defining properties and getters for each of the components in the DMN `ItemDefinition`. If necessary, you can also use the `@FEELProperty` annotation for those getters representing a component name which would result in an invalid Java identifier.
* `java.util.Map` interface: The map needs to define the appropriate entries, with the keys corresponding to the component name in the DMN `ItemDefinition`.
--

Ranges (or intervals)::
FEEL has `range` literals that you can use to create ranges or intervals. A `range` in FEEL is a value that defines a lower and an upper bound, where either can be open or closed. The DMN specification currently does not provide an explicit way of declaring a variable as a `range`, but {PRODUCT} extends the DMN built-in types to support variables of ranges.
+
--
The syntax of a range is defined in the following formats:
----
range          := interval_start endpoint '..' endpoint interval_end
interval_start := open_start | closed_start
open_start     := '(' | ']'
closed_start   := '['
interval_end   := open_end | closed_end
open_end       := ')' | '['
closed_end     := ']'
endpoint       := expression
----

The expression for the endpoint must return a comparable value, and the lower bound endpoint must be lower than the upper bound endpoint.

For example, the following literal expression defines an interval between `1` and `10`, including the boundaries (a closed interval on both endpoints):

----
[ 1 .. 10 ]
----

The following literal expression defines an interval between 1 hour and 12 hours, including the lower boundary (a closed interval), but excluding the upper boundary (an open interval):

----
[ duration("PT1H") .. duration("PT12H") )
----

You can use ranges in decision tables to test for ranges of values, or use ranges in simple literal expressions. For example, the following literal expression returns `true` if the value of a variable `x` is between `0` and `100`:

----
x in [ 1 .. 100 ]
----
--

Lists::
FEEL has `list` literals that you can use to create lists of items. A `list` in FEEL is represented by a comma-separated list of values enclosed in square brackets. The DMN specification currently does not provide an explicit way of declaring a variable as a `list`, but {PRODUCT} extends the DMN built-in types to support variables of lists.
+
--
Example:
----
[ 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
----

All lists in FEEL contain elements of the same type and are immutable. Elements in a list can be accessed by index, where the first element is `1`. Negative indexes can access elements starting from the end of the list so that `-1` is the last element.

For example, the following expression returns the second element of a list `x`:

----
x[2]
----

The following expression returns the second-to-last element of a list `x`:

----
x[-2]
----

Elements in a list can also be counted by the function `count`, which uses the list of elements as the parameter.

For example, the following expression returns `4`:

----
count([ 2, 3, 4, 5 ])
----

[id="ref-dmn-feel-variable-function-names"]
=== Variable and function names in FEEL

[role="_abstract"]
Unlike many traditional expression languages, Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) supports spaces and a few special characters as part of variable and function names. A FEEL name must start with a `letter`, `?`, or `_` element. The unicode letter characters are also allowed. Variable names cannot start with a language keyword, such as `and`, `true`, or `every`. The remaining characters in a variable name can be any of the starting characters, as well as `digits`, white spaces, and special characters such as `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `'`, and `.`.

For example, the following names are all valid FEEL names:

* Age
* Birth Date
* Flight 234 pre-check procedure

Several limitations apply to variable and function names in FEEL:

Ambiguity::
The use of spaces, keywords, and other special characters as part of names can make FEEL ambiguous. The ambiguities are resolved in the context of the expression, matching names from left to right. The parser resolves the variable name as the longest name matched in scope. You can use `( )` to disambiguate names if necessary.

Spaces in names::
The DMN specification limits the use of spaces in FEEL names. According to the DMN specification, names can contain multiple spaces but not two consecutive spaces.
+
--
In order to make the language easier to use and avoid common errors due to spaces, {PRODUCT} removes the limitation on the use of consecutive spaces. {PRODUCT} supports variable names with any number of consecutive spaces, but normalizes them into a single space. For example, the variable references `First Name` with one space and `First  Name` with two spaces are both acceptable in {PRODUCT}.

{PRODUCT} also normalizes the use of other white spaces, like the non-breakable white space that is common in web pages, tabs, and line breaks. From a {PRODUCT} FEEL engine perspective, all of these characters are normalized into a single white space before processing.
--

The keyword `in`::
The keyword `in` is the only keyword in the language that cannot be used as part of a variable name. Although the specifications allow the use of keywords in the middle of variable names, the use of `in` in variable names conflicts with the grammar definition of `for`, `every` and `some` expression constructs.

[id="con-dmn-boxed-expressions"]
=== DMN decision logic in boxed expressions

[role="_abstract"]
Boxed expressions in DMN are tables that you use to define the underlying logic of decision nodes and business knowledge models in a decision requirements diagram (DRD). Some boxed expressions can contain other boxed expressions, but the top-level boxed expression corresponds to the decision logic of a single DRD artifact. While DRDs represent the flow of a DMN decision model, boxed expressions define the actual decision logic of individual nodes. DRDs and boxed expressions together form a complete and functional DMN decision model.

The following are the types of DMN boxed expressions:

* link:#con-dmn-decision-tables[Decision tables]
* link:#con-dmn-literal-expressions[Literal expressions]
* link:#con-dmn-context-expressions[Contexts]
* link:#con-dmn-relation-expressions[Relations]
* link:#con-dmn-function-expressions[Functions]
* link:#con-dmn-invocation-expressions[Invocations]
* link:#con-dmn-list-expressions[Lists]

All Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) expressions that you use in your boxed expressions must conform to the FEEL syntax requirements in the OMG https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].


[id="con-dmn-decision-tables"]
==== DMN decision tables

[role="_abstract"]
A decision table in DMN is a visual representation of one or more business rules in a tabular format. You use decision tables to define rules for a decision node that applies those rules at a given point in the decision model. Each rule consists of a single row in the table, and includes columns that define the conditions (input, light blue in the picture below) and outcome (output, dark blue in the picture below) for that particular row. The definition of each row is precise enough to derive the outcome using the values of the conditions. Input and output values can be FEEL expressions or defined data type values.

For example, the following decision table determines applicant qualification for a loan as the concluding decision node in a loan prequalification decision model:

.Decision table for loan prequalification
image::dmn-decision-table-example3.png[]

Decision tables are a popular way of modeling rules and decision logic, and are used in many methodologies (such as DMN) and implementation frameworks (such as Drools).

IMPORTANT: {PRODUCT} supports both DMN decision tables and Drools-native decision tables, but they are different types of assets with different syntax requirements and are not interchangeable.

[id="con-dmn-decision-tables-hit-policies"]
===== Hit policies in DMN decision tables

[role="_abstract"]
Hit policies determine how to reach an outcome when multiple rules in a decision table match the provided input values. For example, if one rule in a decision table applies a sales discount to military personnel and another rule applies a discount to students, then when a customer is both a student and in the military, the decision table hit policy must indicate whether to apply one discount or the other (*Unique*, *First*) or both discounts (*Collect Sum*). You specify the single character of the hit policy (*U*, *F*, *C+*) in the upper-left corner of the decision table.

The following decision table hit policies are supported in DMN:

* *Unique (U):* Permits only one rule to match. Any overlap raises an error.
* *Any (A):* Permits multiple rules to match, but they must all have the same output. If multiple matching rules do not have the same output, an error is raised.
* *Priority (P):* Permits multiple rules to match, with different outputs. The output that comes first in the output values list is selected.
* *First (F):* Uses the first match in rule order.
* *Collect (C+, C>, C<, C#):* Aggregates output from multiple rules based on an aggregation function.
** *Collect ( C ):* Aggregates values in an arbitrary list.
** *Collect Sum (C+):* Outputs the sum of all collected values. Values must be numeric.
** *Collect Min (C<):* Outputs the minimum value among the matches. The resulting values must be comparable, such as numbers, dates, or text (lexicographic order).
** *Collect Max (C>):* Outputs the maximum value among the matches. The resulting values must be comparable, such as numbers, dates or text (lexicographic order).
** *Collect Count (C#):* Outputs the number of matching rules.

[id="con-dmn-literal-expressions"]
==== Boxed literal expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed literal expression in DMN is a literal FEEL expression as text in a table cell, typically with a labeled column and an assigned data type. You use boxed literal expressions to define simple or complex node logic or decision data directly in FEEL for a particular node in a decision. Literal FEEL expressions must conform to FEEL syntax requirements in the OMG https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].

For example, the following boxed literal expression defines the minimum acceptable PITI calculation (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) in a lending decision, where `acceptable rate` is a variable defined in the DMN model:

.Boxed literal expression for minimum PITI value
image::dmn-literal-expression-example2.png[]

The following boxed literal expression sorts a list of possible dating candidates (soul mates) in an online dating application based on their score on criteria such as age, location, and interests:

==== Boxed context expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed context expression in DMN is a set of variable names and values with a result value. Each name-value pair is a context entry. You use context expressions to represent data definitions in decision logic and set a value for a desired decision element within the DMN decision model. A value in a boxed context expression can be a data type value or FEEL expression, or can contain a nested sub-expression of any type, such as a decision table, a literal expression, or another context expression.

For example, the following boxed context expression defines the factors for sorting delayed passengers in a flight-rebooking decision model, based on defined data types (`tPassengerTable`, `tFlightNumberList`):

The following boxed context expression defines the factors that determine whether a loan applicant can meet minimum mortgage payments based on principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI), represented as a front-end ratio calculation with a sub-context expression:

==== Boxed relation expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed relation expression in DMN is a traditional data table with information about given entities, listed as rows. You use boxed relation tables to define decision data for relevant entities in a decision at a particular node. Boxed relation expressions are similar to context expressions in that they set variable names and values, but relation expressions contain no result value and list all variable values based on a single defined variable in each column.

For example, the following boxed relation expression provides information about employees in an employee rostering decision:

==== Boxed function expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed function expression in DMN is a parameterized boxed expression containing a literal FEEL expression, a nested context expression of an external JAVA or PMML function, or a nested boxed expression of any type. By default, all business knowledge models are defined as boxed function expressions. You use boxed function expressions to call functions on your decision logic and to define all business knowledge models.

For example, the following boxed function expression determines airline flight capacity is enough in a flight-rebooking decision model:

.Boxed function expression for flight capacity

The following boxed function expression contains a basic Java function as a context expression for determining absolute value in a decision model calculation:

.Boxed function expression for absolute value

The following boxed function expression determines a monthly mortgage installment as a business knowledge model in a lending decision, with the function value defined as a nested context expression:

.Boxed function expression for installment calculation in business knowledge model

The following boxed function expression uses a PMML model included in the DMN file to define the minimum acceptable PITI calculation (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) in a lending decision:

==== Boxed invocation expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed invocation expression in DMN is a boxed expression that invokes a business knowledge model. A boxed invocation expression contains the name of the business knowledge model to be invoked and a list of parameter bindings. Each binding is represented by two boxed expressions on a row: The box on the left contains the name of a parameter and the box on the right contains the binding expression whose value is assigned to the parameter to evaluate the invoked business knowledge model. You use boxed invocations to invoke at a particular decision node a business knowledge model defined in the decision model.

For example, the following boxed invocation expression invokes a `Reassign Next Passenger` business knowledge model as the concluding decision node in a flight-rebooking decision model:

.Boxed invocation expression to reassign flight passengers

The following boxed invocation expression invokes an `InstallmentCalculation` business knowledge model to calculate a monthly installment amount for a loan before proceeding to affordability decisions:

[id="con-dmn-list-expressions"]
==== Boxed list expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed list expression in DMN represents a FEEL list of items. You use boxed lists to define lists of relevant items for a particular node in a decision. You can also use literal FEEL expressions for list items in cells to create more complex lists.

For example, the following boxed list expression identifies approved credit score agencies in a loan application decision service:

.Boxed list expression for approved credit score agencies
image::dmn-list-expression-example.png[]

The following boxed list expression also identifies approved credit score agencies but uses FEEL logic to define the agency status (Inc., LLC, SA, GA) based on a DMN input node:

=== DMN model example

[role="_abstract"]
The following is a real-world DMN model example that demonstrates how you can use decision modeling to reach a decision based on input data, circumstances, and company guidelines. In this scenario, a flight from San Diego to New York is canceled, requiring the affected airline to find alternate arrangements for its inconvenienced passengers.

First, the airline collects the information necessary to determine how best to get the travelers to their destinations:

Input data::
* List of flights
* List of passengers

Decisions::
* Prioritize the passengers who will get seats on a new flight
* Determine which flights those passengers will be offered

Business knowledge models::
* The company process for determining passenger priority
* Any flights that have space available
* Company rules for determining how best to reassign inconvenienced passengers

The airline then uses the DMN standard to model its decision process in the following decision requirements diagram (DRD) for determining the best rebooking solution:

.DRD for flight rebooking
image::dmn-passenger-rebooking-drd.png[]

Similar to flowcharts, DRDs use shapes to represent the different elements in a process. Ovals contain the two necessary input data, rectangles contain the decision points in the model, and rectangles with clipped corners (business knowledge models) contain reusable logic that can be repeatedly invoked.

The DRD draws logic for each element from boxed expressions that provide variable definitions using FEEL expressions or data type values.

Some boxed expressions are basic, such as the following decision for establishing a prioritized waiting list:

.Boxed context expression example for prioritized wait list
image::dmn-context-expression-example.png[]

Some boxed expressions are more complex with greater detail and calculation, such as the following business knowledge model for reassigning the next delayed passenger:

== DMN support in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
{PRODUCT} provides runtime support for DMN 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 models at conformance level 3 and design support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3. You can design your DMN models with the {CANVAS} or import existing DMN models into your {PRODUCT} projects for deployment and execution. Any DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models (do not contain DMN 1.3 features) that you import, open in the DMN designer, and save are converted to DMN 1.2 models.

The following table summarizes the design and runtime support for each DMN version in {PRODUCT}:

In addition to all DMN conformance level 3 requirements, {PRODUCT} also includes enhancements and fixes to FEEL and DMN model components to optimize the experience of implementing DMN decision services with {PRODUCT}. From a platform perspective, DMN models are like any other business asset in {PRODUCT}, such as DRL files or spreadsheet decision tables, that you can include in your {PRODUCT} project and execute to start your DMN decision services.

[id="con-dmn-validation"]
=== Configurable DMN validation in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
By default, the {PRODUCT} CodeGen component uses the `kogito.decisions.validation=ENABLED` configuration to perform pre-compilation validation of DMN model assets and to perform DMN decision table static analysis.

When this configuration is enabled, {PRODUCT} performs the following DMN validations:

* DMN model files are verified against the DMN specification XSD schema to ensure that the files are valid XML and compliant with the specification.
* The pre-compilation analysis is performed for the DMN model to ensure that the basic semantic is aligned with the DMN specification.
* DMN decision tables are statically analyzed for gaps or overlaps and to ensure that the semantic of the decision table follows best practices.

Any DMN validation error causes the {PRODUCT} CodeGen build to fail and errors are reported accordingly, as shown in the following example:

.DMN validation errors
image::kogito-dmn-validation-con-error.png[Image of DMN validation errors]

You can modify the default DMN validation and DMN decision table analysis behavior to ignore errors during the project build, or you can disable this default behavior completely, as shown in the following examples:

.Default configuration for DMN validation and decision table analysis
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=ENABLED
----

.Configuration to validate DMN models and DMN decision tables but ignore errors
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=IGNORE
----

.Configuration to disable all DMN validation
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=DISABLED
----

NOTE: If you enter an unrecognized `kogito.decisions.validation` configuration flag, all pre-compilation validation features are disabled and the {PRODUCT} CodeGen emits related log messages.

ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
[id="ref-dmn-feel-enhancements"]
=== FEEL enhancements in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
{PRODUCT} includes the following enhancements and other changes to FEEL in the current DMN implementation:

* _Space Sensitivity_: This DMN implementation of the FEEL language is space insensitive. The goal is to avoid non-deterministic behavior based on the context and differences in behavior based on invisible characters, such as white spaces. This means that for this implementation, a variable named `first name` with one space is exactly the same as `first  name` with two spaces in it.

* __List functions `or()` and `and()` __: The specification defines two list functions named `or()` and `and()`. However,
according to the FEEL grammar, these are not valid function names, as `and` and `or` are reserved keywords.
 This implementation renames these functions to `any()` and `all()` respectively, in anticipation for DMN 1.2.

* __Keyword `in` cannot be used in variable names__: The specification defines that any keyword can be reused as part
 of a variable name, but the ambiguities caused with the `for ... in ... return` loop prevent the reuse of the `in`
 keyword. All other keywords are supported as part of variable names.

* __Keywords are not supported in attributes of anonymous types__: FEEL is not a strongly typed language and the parser must resolve ambiguity in name parts of an attribute of an anonymous type. The parser supports reusable keywords as part of a variable name defined in the scope, but the parser does not support keywords in attributes of an anonymous type. For example, `for item in Order.items return Federal Tax for Item( item )` is a valid and supported FEEL expression, where a function named `Federal Tax for Item(...)` can be defined and invoked correctly in the scope. However, the expression `for i in [ {x and y : true, n : 1}, {x and y : false, n: 2} ] return i.x and y` is not supported because anonymous types are defined in the iteration context of the `for` expression and the parser cannot resolve the ambiguity.

* __Support for date and time literals on ranges__: According to the grammar rules #8, #18, #19, #34 and #62, `date
 and time` literals are supported in ranges (pages 110-111). Chapter 10.3.2.7 on page 114, on the other hand, contradicts
 the grammar and says they are not supported. This implementation chose to follow the grammar and support `date and
 time` literals on ranges, as well as extend the specification to support any arbitrary expression (see extensions below).

* __Invalid time syntax__: Chapter 10.3.2.3.4 on page 112 and bullet point about `time` on page 131 both state that
 the `time` string lexical representation follows the XML Schema Datatypes specification as well as ISO 8601. According
 to the XML Schema specification (https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#time), the lexical representation of a time follows
 the pattern `hh:mm:ss.sss` without any leading character. The DMN specification uses a leading "T" in several examples,
 that we understand is a typo and not in accordance with the standard.

* __Support for scientific and hexadecimal notations__: This implementation supports scientific and hexadecimal
  notation for numbers. For example, `1.2e5` (scientific notation), `0xD5` (hexadecimal notation).

* __Support for expressions as end points in ranges__: This implementation supports expressions as endpoints
  for ranges. For example, `[date("2016-11-24")..date("2016-11-27")]`

* __Support for additional types__: The specification only defines the following as basic types of the language:
  ** number
  ** string
  ** boolean
  ** days and time duration
  ** years and month duration
  ** time
  ** date and time
+
For completeness and orthogonality, this implementation also supports the following types:

  ** context
  ** list
  ** range
  ** function
  ** unary test

* __Support for unary tests__: For completeness and orthogonality, unary tests are supported
  as first class citizens in the language. They are functions with an implicit single
  parameter and can be invoked in the same way as functions. For example,
+
[source,json]
.UnaryTestAsFunction.feel
----
  {
      is minor : < 18,
      Bob is minor : is minor( bob.age )
  }
----

* __Support for additional built-in functions__: The following additional functions are supported:

  ** `now()` : Returns the current local date and time.
  ** `today()` : Returns the current local date.
  ** `decision table()` : Returns a decision table function, although the specification mentions a decision table.
  The function on page 114 is not implementable as defined.
  ** `string( mask, p... )` : Returns a string formatted as per the mask. See Java String.format() for
  details on the mask syntax. For example, `string( "%4.2f", 7.1298 )` returns the string `"7.12"`.

* __Support for additional date and time arithmetics__: Subtracting two dates returns a day and time duration with the number of days between the two
  dates, ignoring daylight savings. For example,
+
[source,json]
.DateArithmetic.feel
----
date( "2017-05-12" ) - date( "2017-04-25" ) = duration( "P17D" )
----

[id="ref-dmn-model-enhancements"]
=== DMN model enhancements in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
{PRODUCT} includes the following enhancements to DMN model support in the current DMN implementation:

* __Support for types with spaces on names__: The DMN XML schema defines type refs such as QNames. The QNames do not allow spaces. Therefore, it is not possible to use types like FEEL `date and time`,   `days and time duration` or `years and months duration`. This implementation does parse such typerefs as strings and allows type names with spaces. However, in order to comply with the XML schema, it also adds the following aliases to such types that can be used instead:

  ** `date and time` = `dateTime`
  ** `days and time duration` = `duration` or `dayTimeDuration`
  ** `years and months duration` = `duration` or `yearMonthDuration`
+
Note that, for the "duration" types, the user can simply use `duration` and the decision engine will infer the proper duration, either `days and time duration` or `years and months duration`.

* __Lists support heterogeneous element types__: Currently this implementation supports lists with heterogeneous element types. This is an experimental extension and does limit the functionality of some functions and filters. This decision will be re-evaluated in the future.

* __TypeRef link between Decision Tables and Item Definitions__: On decision tables/input clause, if no values list is defined, the decision engine automatically checks the type reference and applies the allowed values check if it is defined.

== Creating and editing DMN models in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the {VS_CODE_BUNDLE_LINK}[*{VS_CODE_BUNDLE}*] to design DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) and define decision logic for a complete and functional DMN decision model. {PRODUCT} provides design support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3, and includes enhancements and fixes to FEEL and DMN model components to optimize the experience of implementing DMN decision services with {PRODUCT}. {PRODUCT} also provides runtime support for DMN 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 models at conformance level 3. Any DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models (do not contain DMN 1.3 features) that you import, open in the DMN designer, and save are converted to DMN 1.2 models.

.Procedure
. In your VSCode IDE, create or import a DMN file in the relevant folder of your {PRODUCT} project, typically in `src/main/resources`.
. Open the new or imported DMN file to view the decision requirements diagram (DRD) in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler.
+
--
If the DRD does not open in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler, ensure that you have installed and enabled the {VS_CODE_BUNDLE_LINK}[*{VS_CODE_BUNDLE}*].

If the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler opens only the XML source of the DMN file and displays an error message, review the reported errors and the DMN model file to ensure that all DMN elements are correctly defined.
--
. Begin adding components to your new or imported DRD by clicking and dragging one of the DMN nodes from the left toolbar:
+
--
.Adding DRD components
image::dmn-drag-decision-node.png[]

The following DRD link:#_dmn_decision_requirements_diagram_drd_components[components] are available.

--
. In the DMN modeler canvas, double-click the new DRD node to enter an informative node name.
. If the node is a decision or business knowledge model, select the node to display the node options and click the *Edit* icon to open the DMN boxed expression editor to define the decision logic for the node:
+
--
.Opening a new decision node boxed expression
image::dmn-decision-edit.png[]

.Opening a new business knowledge model boxed expression
image::dmn-bkm-edit.png[]

By default, all business knowledge models are defined as boxed function expressions containing a literal FEEL expression, a nested context expression of an external JAVA or PMML function, or a nested boxed expression of any type.

For decision nodes, you click the undefined table to select the type of boxed expression you want to use, such as a boxed literal expression, boxed context expression, decision table, or other DMN boxed expression.

.Selecting the logic type for a decision node
image::dmn-decision-boxed-expression-options.png[]

For business knowledge models, you click the upper-left function cell to select the function type, or right-click the function value cell, select *Clear*, and select a boxed expression of another type.

.Selecting the function or other logic type for a business knowledge model
image::dmn-bkm-define.png[]
--
. In the selected boxed expression editor for either a decision node (any expression type) or business knowledge model (function expression), click the applicable table cells to define the table name, variable data types, variable names and values, function parameters and bindings, or FEEL expressions to include in the decision logic.
+
--
You can right-click cells for additional actions where applicable, such as inserting or removing table rows and columns or clearing table contents.

The following is an example decision table for a decision node that determines credit score ratings based on a defined range of a loan applicant's credit score:

.Decision node decision table for credit score rating
image::dmn-decision-table-example1a.png[]

The following is an example boxed function expression for a business knowledge model that calculates mortgage payments based on principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI) as a literal expression:

.Business knowledge model function for PITI calculation
image::dmn-function-expression-example4.png[]
--
. After you define the decision logic for the selected node, click *Back to __MODEL_NAME__* to return to the DRD view.
. For the selected DRD node, use the available connection options to create and connect to the next node in the DRD, or click and drag a new node onto the DRD canvas from the left toolbar.
+
--
The node type determines which connection options are supported. For example, an *Input data* node can connect to a decision node, knowledge source, or text annotation using the applicable connection type, whereas a *Knowledge source* node can connect to any DRD element. A *Decision* node can connect only to another decision or a text annotation.

The following connection types are available, depending on the node type:

* *Information requirement*: Use this connection from an input data node or decision node to another decision node that requires the information.
* *Knowledge requirement*: Use this connection from a business knowledge model to a decision node or to another business knowledge model that invokes the decision logic.
* *Authority requirement*: Use this connection from an input data node or a decision node to a dependent knowledge source or from a knowledge source to a decision node, business knowledge model, or another knowledge source.
* *Association*: Use this connection from an input data node, decision node, business knowledge model, or knowledge source to a text annotation.

// here we finished some 'partial' steps how some diagram is designed
// how to add conections
// how to fill in some of expression types
// in the end we provide some picture, but no source or link to source of complete diagram
The following is an example DRD for a loan prequalification decision model:

.Completed DRD for loan prequalification

// here we provide an example of a decision service node
// but in the procedure above, we do not guide any step that would lead to a decision service in the picture below

The following is an example DRD for a phone call handling decision model using a reusable decision service:

.Completed DRD for phone call handling with a decision service
image::dmn-example-drd3.png[width=90%]

In a DMN decision service node, the decision nodes in the bottom segment incorporate input data from outside of the decision service to arrive at a final decision in the top segment of the decision service node. The resulting top-level decisions from the decision service are then implemented in any subsequent decisions or business knowledge requirements of the DMN model. You can reuse DMN decision services in other DMN models to apply the same decision logic with different input data and different outgoing connections.

=== Defining DMN decision logic in boxed expressions in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler

[role="_abstract"]
Boxed expressions in DMN are tables that you use to define the underlying logic of decision nodes and business knowledge models in a decision requirements diagram (DRD). Some boxed expressions can contain other boxed expressions, but the top-level boxed expression corresponds to the decision logic of a single DRD artifact. While DRDs represent the flow of a DMN decision model, boxed expressions define the actual decision logic of individual nodes. DRDs and boxed expressions together form a complete and functional DMN decision model.

You can use the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler in VSCode to define decision logic for your DRD components using built-in boxed expressions.

.Procedure
. In your VSCode IDE, open the DMN file to view the decision requirements diagram (DRD) in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler.
+
--
If the DRD does not open in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler, ensure that you have installed and enabled the {VS_CODE_BUNDLE_LINK}[*{VS_CODE_BUNDLE}*].

If the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler opens only the XML source of the DMN file and displays an error message, review the reported errors and the DMN model file to ensure that all DMN elements are correctly defined.
--
. In the DMN modeler canvas, select a decision node or business knowledge model node that you want to define and click the *Edit* icon to open the DMN boxed expression editor:
+
--
.Opening a new decision node boxed expression
image::dmn-decision-edit.png[]

.Opening a new business knowledge model boxed expression
image::dmn-bkm-edit.png[]

By default, all business knowledge models are defined as boxed function expressions containing a literal FEEL expression, a nested context expression of an external JAVA or PMML function, or a nested boxed expression of any type.

For decision nodes, you click the undefined table to select the type of boxed expression you want to use, such as a boxed literal expression, boxed context expression, decision table, or other DMN boxed expression.

.Selecting the logic type for a decision node
image::dmn-decision-boxed-expression-options.png[]

For business knowledge model nodes, you click the upper-left function cell to select the function type, or right-click the function value cell, select *Clear*, and select a boxed expression of another type.

.Selecting the function or other logic type for a business knowledge model
image::dmn-bkm-define.png[]
--
. For this example, use a decision node and select *Decision Table* as the boxed expression type.
+
A decision table in DMN is a visual representation of one or more rules in a tabular format. Each rule consists of a single row in the table, and includes columns that define the conditions (input) and outcome (output) for that particular row.
. Click the input column header to define the name and data type for the input condition. For example, name the input column *Credit Score.FICO* with a `number` data type. This column specifies numeric credit score values or ranges of loan applicants.
. Click the output column header to define the name and data type for the output values. For example, name the output column *Credit Score Rating* and next to the *Data Type* option, click *Manage* to go to the *Data Types* page where you can create a custom data type with score ratings as constraints.
+
.Managing data types for a column header value
image::dmn-manage-data-types.png[]

. On the *Data Types* page, click *New Data Type* to add a new data type.
+
--
For this example, click *New Data Type* and create a *Credit_Score_Rating* data type as a `string`:

.Adding a new data type
image::dmn-custom-data-type-add.png[]
--
. Click *Add Constraints*, select *Enumeration* from the drop-down options, and add the following constraints:
+
--
* `"Excellent"`
* `"Good"`
* `"Fair"`
* `"Poor"`
* `"Bad"`

.Adding constraints to the new data type
image::dmn-custom-data-type-constraints.png[]

// documenting that user can change order of enums doesn't seems to me as bringign much value
// taking into account we use a picture for it, it prolongs the documentation, we repeat it twice in the docuemntation
To change the order of data type constraints, you can click the left end of the constraint row and drag the row as needed:

.Dragging constraints to change constraint order
image::dmn-custom-data-type-constraints-drag.png[]

For information about constraint types and syntax requirements for the specified data type, see the https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].
--

. Click *OK* to save the constraints and click the check mark to the right of the data type to save the data type.
. Return to the *Credit Score Rating* decision table, click the *Credit Score Rating* column header, and set the data type to this new custom data type.
. Use the *Credit Score.FICO* input column to define credit score values or ranges of values, and use the *Credit Score Rating* column to specify one of the corresponding ratings you defined in the *Credit_Score_Rating* data type.
+
Right-click any value cell to insert or delete rows (rules) or columns (clauses).
+
.Decision node decision table for credit score rating
image::dmn-decision-table-example1a.png[]

. After you define all rules, click the upper-left corner of the decision table to define the rule *Hit Policy* and *Builtin Aggregator* (for *COLLECT* hit policy only).
+
--
The hit policy determines how to reach an outcome when multiple rules in a decision table match the provided input values. The built-in aggregator determines how to aggregate rule values when you use the *COLLECT* hit policy.

.Defining the decision table hit policy
image::dmn-hit-policies.png[]

The following example is a more complex decision table that determines applicant qualification for a loan as the concluding decision node in the same loan prequalification decision model:

.Decision table for loan prequalification
image::dmn-decision-table-example3.png[]
--

For boxed expression types other than decision tables, you follow these guidelines similarly to navigate the boxed expression tables and define variables and parameters for decision logic, but according to the requirements of the boxed expression type. Some boxed expressions, such as boxed literal expressions, can be single-column tables, while other boxed expressions, such as function, context, and invocation expressions, can be multi-column tables with nested boxed expressions of other types.

For example, the following boxed context expression defines the parameters that determine whether a loan applicant can meet minimum mortgage payments based on principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI), represented as a front-end ratio calculation with a sub-context expression:

.Boxed context expression for front-end client PITI ratio
image::dmn-context-expression-example2.png[]

The following boxed function expression determines a monthly mortgage installment as a business knowledge model in a lending decision, with the function value defined as a nested context expression:

.Boxed function expression for installment calculation in business knowledge model
image::dmn-function-expression-example3.png[]

For more information and examples of each boxed expression type, see xref:con-dmn-boxed-expressions[].

[id="proc-dmn-data-types-defining"]
=== Creating custom data types for DMN boxed expressions in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler

[role="_abstract"]
In DMN boxed expressions in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler, data types determine the structure of the data that you use within an associated table, column, or field in the boxed expression. You can use default DMN data types (such as String, Number, Boolean) or you can create custom data types to specify additional fields and constraints that you want to implement for the boxed expression values.

Custom data types that you create for a boxed expression can be simple or structured:

* *Simple* data types have only a name and a type assignment. Example: `Age (number)`.
* *Structured* data types contain multiple fields associated with a parent data type. Example: A single type `Person` containing the fields `Name (string)`, `Age (number)`, `Email (string)`.

// if we read the procedure, it repeats also steps for creating boxed expression, that is already demonstrated earlier
// - we could link creating/defining expression
// - we could link code snippets on gist/github to able users play with similar models quicker instead of creating them from scratch
.Procedure
. In your VSCode IDE, open the DMN file to view the decision requirements diagram (DRD) in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler.
+
--
If the DRD does not open in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler, ensure that you have installed and enabled the {VS_CODE_BUNDLE_LINK}[*{VS_CODE_BUNDLE}*].
// extract this snippet in a seaprate .adoc and reuse, it is repeated 6x

If the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler opens only the XML source of the DMN file and displays an error message, review the reported errors and the DMN model file to ensure that all DMN elements are correctly defined.
--
. In the DMN modeler canvas, select a decision node or business knowledge model for which you want to define the data types and click the *Edit* icon to open the DMN boxed expression editor.
. If the boxed expression is for a decision node that is not yet defined, click the undefined table to select the type of boxed expression you want to use, such as a boxed literal expression, boxed context expression, decision table, or other DMN boxed expression.
+
.Selecting the logic type for a decision node
image::dmn-decision-boxed-expression-options.png[]

. Click the cell for the table header, column header, or parameter field (depending on the boxed expression type) for which you want to define the data type and click *Manage* to go to the *Data Types* page where you can create a custom data type.
+
--
.Managing data types for a column header value
image::dmn-manage-data-types.png[]

You can also set and manage custom data types for a specified decision node or business knowledge model node by selecting the *Properties* icon in the upper-right corner of the DMN modeler:

.Managing data types in decision requirements diagram (DRD) properties
image::dmn-manage-data-types1a.png[]

The data type that you define for a specified cell in a boxed expression determines the structure of the data that you use within that associated table, column, or field in the boxed expression.

In this example, an output column *Credit Score Rating* for a DMN decision table defines a set of custom credit score ratings based on an applicant's credit score.
--
. On the *Data Types* page, click *New Data Type* to add a new data type.
+
--
For this example, click *New Data Type* and create a *Credit_Score_Rating* data type as a `string`:

.Adding a new data type
image::dmn-custom-data-type-add.png[]

If the data type requires a list of items, enable the *List* setting.
--
. Click *Add Constraints*, select *Enumeration* from the drop-down options, and add the following constraints:
+
--
* `"Excellent"`
* `"Good"`
* `"Fair"`
* `"Poor"`
* `"Bad"`

.Adding constraints to the new data type
image::dmn-custom-data-type-constraints.png[]

To change the order of data type constraints, you can click the left end of the constraint row and drag the row as needed:

.Dragging constraints to change constraint order
image::dmn-custom-data-type-constraints-drag.png[]

For information about constraint types and syntax requirements for the specified data type, see the https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].
--

. Click *OK* to save the constraints and click the check mark to the right of the data type to save the data type.

. Return to the *Credit Score Rating* decision table, click the *Credit Score Rating* column header, set the data type to this new custom data type, and define the rule values for that column with the rating constraints that you specified.
+
--
.Decision table for credit score rating
image::dmn-decision-table-example1a.png[]

In the DMN decision model for this scenario, the *Credit Score Rating* decision flows into the following *Loan Prequalification* decision that also requires custom data types:

.Decision table for loan prequalification
image::dmn-manage-data-types-blank.png[]
--
. Continuing with this example, return to the *Data Types* window, click *New Data Type*, and create a *Loan_Qualification* data type as a `Structure` with no constraints.
+
--
When you save the new structured data type, the first sub-field appears so that you can begin defining nested data fields in this parent data type. You can use these sub-fields in association with the parent structured data type in boxed expressions, such as nested column headers in decision tables or nested table parameters in context or function expressions.

For additional sub-fields, select the addition icon next to the *Loan_Qualification* data type.

--
. For this example, under the structured *Loan_Qualification* data type, add a *Qualification* field with `"Qualified"` and `"Not Qualified"` enumeration constraints, and a *Reason* field with no constraints. Add also a simple *Back_End_Ratio* and a *Front_End_Ratio* data type, both with `"Sufficient"` and `"Insufficient"` enumeration constraints.

=== Creating DMN models with multiple diagrams in {VS_CODE_BUNDLE}

[role="_abstract"]
For complex DMN models, you can use the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler in VSCode to design multiple DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) that represent parts of the overall decision requirements graph (DRG) for the DMN decision model. In simple cases, you can use a single DRD to represent all of the overall DRG for the decision model, but in complex cases, a single DRD can become large and difficult to follow. Therefore, to better organize DMN decision models with many decision requirements, you can divide the model into smaller nested DRDs that constitute the larger central DRD representation of the overall DRG.

.Procedure
. In your VSCode IDE, create or import a DMN file in the relevant folder of your {PRODUCT} project, typically in `src/main/resources`.

. Open the new or imported DMN file to view the DRD in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler, and begin designing or modifying the DRD using the DMN nodes in the left toolbar.
+
--
If the DRD does not open in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler, ensure that you have installed and enabled the {VS_CODE_BUNDLE_LINK}[*{VS_CODE_BUNDLE}*].

If the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler opens only the XML source of the DMN file and displays an error message, review the reported errors and the DMN model file to ensure that all DMN elements are correctly defined.
--
. For any DMN nodes that you want to define in a separate nested DRD, select the node, click the *DRD Actions* icon, and select from the available options.
+
--
.DRD actions icon for subdividing a DRD
image::dmn-drd-actions.png[]

The following options are available:

* *Create*: Use this option to create a nested DRD where you can separately define the DMN components and diagram for the selected node.
* *Add to*: If you already created a nested DRD, use this option to add the selected node to an existing DRD.
* *Remove*: If the node that you selected is already within a nested DRD, use this option to remove the node from that nested DRD.

After you create a nested DRD within your DMN decision model, the new DRD opens in a separate DRD canvas and the available DRD and components are listed in the *Decision Navigator* right menu. You can use the *Decision Navigator* menu to rename or remove a nested DRD.

.Rename new nested DRD in the Decision Navigator menu
image::dmn-drd-actions-rename.png[]
--
. In the separate canvas for the new nested DRD, design the flow and logic for all required components in this portion of the DMN model, as usual.
. Continue adding and defining any other nested DRDs for your decision model and save the completed DMN file.
+
--
For example, the following DRD for a loan prequalification decision model contains all DMN components for the model without any nested DRDs. This example relies on the single DRD for all components and logic, resulting in a large and complex diagram.

.Single DRD for loan prequalification
image::dmn-example-drd.png[]

Alternatively, by following the steps in this procedure, you can divide this example DRD into multiple nested DRDs to better organize the decision requirements, as shown in the following example:
// the procedure bellow demonstrates spliting one DMN diagram into more DRDs, however we use a lot of screenshots , not much instructions.
// probably we could replace this with short text and link for complete dmn source file

== {PRODUCT} service execution

[role="_abstract"]
After you design your {PRODUCT} service, you can build and run your application and then send REST API requests to the application to execute your services. The exact REST API requests that you can use depend on how you set up the application.

For example, consider a {PRODUCT} service that is set up to generate a `/persons` REST API endpoint and determines whether a specified customer is an adult or is underage. In this example, you can send the following `POST` request using a REST client or curl utility to add an adult and execute the service:

.Example POST request body to add an adult (JSON)
[source,json]
----
{
  "person": {
    "name": "John Quark",
    "age": 20
  }
}
----

.Example curl command to add an adult
[source]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/persons -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json' -d '{"person": {"name":"John Quark", "age": 20}}'
----

.Example response (JSON)

{
  "id": "3af806dd-8819-4734-a934-728f4c819682",
  "person": {
    "name": "John Quark",
    "age": 20,
    "adult": false
  },
  "isAdult": true
}
----

Note that for JSON marshaling, {PRODUCT} is relying on the default mappers of https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-json#jackson[Quarkus], which can be configured according to the specific requirements.

[id="ref-rest-dmn-endpoints"]
=== REST endpoints for DMN models in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
For each DMN model in a {PRODUCT} application, the following REST endpoints are automatically generated based on the content of the model:

* `[POST] /\{modelName\}`: A business-domain endpoint for evaluating the entire DMN model
* `[POST] /\{modelName\}/\{decisionServiceName\}`: A business-domain endpoint for evaluating a specified decision service component in the DMN model
* `[POST] /\{modelName\}/dmnresult`: An endpoint for evaluating the entire DMN model and returning a `DMNResult` response, including the business-domain context, helper messages, and helper decision pointers for the DMN model
* `[POST] /\{modelName\}/\{decisionServiceName\}/dmnresult`: An endpoint for evaluating a specified decision service component in the DMN model and returning a `DMNResult` response, including the business-domain context, helper messages, and helper decision pointers for the decision service
* `[GET] /\{modelName\}`: An endpoint for returning the DMN XML without decision logic, typically for DMN model introspection

You can use these endpoints to interact with a DMN model or a specific decision service within a model. As you decide between using business-domain and `dmnresult` variants of these REST endpoints, review the following considerations:

* *REST business-domain endpoints*: Use this endpoint type if a client application is only concerned with a positive evaluation outcome, is not interested in parsing `Info` or `Warn` messages, and only needs an HTTP 5xx response for any errors. This type of endpoint is also helpful for single-page application-like clients, due to singleton coercion of decision service results that resemble the DMN modeling behavior.
* *REST `dmnresult` endpoints*: Use this endpoint type if a client needs to parse `Info`, `Warn`, or `Error` messages in all cases.

For each endpoint, use a REST client, curl utility, or Swagger UI (if configured for the application) to send requests with the following components:

* *Base URL*: `http://__HOST__:__PORT__/\{modelName}`
* *Path parameters*:
** `\{modelName\}`: The string identifier of the DMN model, such as `Traffic Violation`
** `\{decisionServiceName\}`: The string identifier of the decision service component in the DMN DRG, such as `TrafficViolationDecisionService`
** `dmnresult`: The string identifier that enables the endpoint to return a full `DMNResult` response with more detailed `Info`, `Warn`, and `Error` messaging
* *HTTP headers*: For `POST` requests only:
** `accept`: `application/json`
** `content-type`: `application/json`
* *HTTP methods*: `GET` or `POST`

The examples in the following endpoints are based on a `Traffic Violation` DMN model that contains a `TrafficViolationDecisionService` decision service component.

For all of these endpoints, if a DMN evaluation `Error` message occurs, a `DMNResult` response is returned along with an HTTP 5xx error. If a DMN `Info` or `Warn` message occurs, the relevant response is returned along with the business-domain REST body, in the `X-{PRODUCT}-decision-messages` extended HTTP header, to be used for client-side business logic. When more refined client-side business logic is required, the client can use the `dmnresult` variant of the endpoints.

Return the DMN XML without decision logic::

For this endpoint, the request body must contain all the requirements of the decision service. The response is the resulting DMN context of the decision service, including the decision values, the original input values, and all other parametric DRG components in serialized form. For example, a business knowledge model is available in string-serialized form in its signature.

If the decision service is composed of a single-output decision, the response is the resulting value of that specific decision. This behavior provides an equivalent value at the API level of a specification feature when invoking the decision service in the model itself. As a result, you can, for example, interact with a DMN decision service from single-page web applications.

== Using spreadsheet decision tables in {PRODUCT} services

[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of business decisions, you can define business rules in a tabular format in spreadsheet decision tables and then include the spreadsheet file in your {PRODUCT} project. These rules are compiled into Drools Rule Language (DRL) for the decision service in your project.

=== Spreadsheet decision tables

[role="_abstract"]
Spreadsheet decision tables are XLS or XLSX spreadsheet files that contain business rules defined in a tabular format. You can include spreadsheet decision tables as part of your {PRODUCT} project. Each row in a decision table is a rule, and each column is a condition, an action, or another rule attribute. After you create and include your spreadsheet decision tables in your project, the rules you defined are compiled into Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules for the decision service.

.Decision table for shipping charges
image::decision-table-example-02.png[Decision table example]

In order for a decision table to be compiled in your {PRODUCT} project, the table must comply with certain structure and syntax requirements within an XLS or XLSX spreadsheet, as shown in this example.

=== Creating spreadsheet decision tables for your {PRODUCT} project

[role="_abstract"]
Spreadsheet decision tables (XLS or XLSX) require two key areas that define rule data: a `RuleSet` area and a `RuleTable` area. The `RuleSet` area of the spreadsheet defines elements that you want to apply globally to all rules in the same package (not only the spreadsheet), such as a rule set name or universal rule attributes. The `RuleTable` area defines the actual rules (rows) and the conditions, actions, and other rule attributes (columns) that constitute that rule table within the specified rule set. A spreadsheet of decision tables can contain multiple `RuleTable` areas, but only one `RuleSet` area.

IMPORTANT: For each {PRODUCT} project, try to include only one spreadsheet of decision tables, containing all necessary `RuleTable` definitions. Although you can include separate decision table spreadsheets, including multiple spreadsheets in the same project package can cause compilation errors from conflicting `RuleSet` or `RuleTable` attributes and is therefore not recommended.

Refer to the following sample spreadsheet as you define your decision table:

// do not put same picture twice, as they are big and very close each other, use reference to previous one
.Sample spreadsheet decision table for shipping charges
image::decision-table-example-02.png[Decision table example]

.Prerequisites
* You have `org.kie.kogito:drools-decisiontables` added to the `pom.xml` file of your {PRODUCT} project to enable decision tables for decision services:

.Procedure
. In a new XLS or XLSX spreadsheet, go to the second or third column and label a cell `RuleSet` (row 1 in example). Reserve the column or columns to the left for descriptive metadata (optional).
. In the next cell to the right, enter a name for the `RuleSet`. This named rule set will contain all `RuleTable` rules defined in the rule package.
. Under the `RuleSet` cell, define any rule attributes (one per cell) that you want to apply globally to all rule tables in the package. Specify attribute values in the cells to the right. For example, you can enter an `Import` label and in the cell to the right, specify relevant data objects from other packages that you want to import into the package for the decision table (in the format `package.name.object.name`).
. Below the `RuleSet` area and in the same column as the `RuleSet` cell, skip a row and label a new cell `RuleTable` (row 7 in example) and enter a table name in the same cell. The name is used as the initial part of the name for all rules derived from this rule table, with the row number appended for distinction. You can override this automatic naming by inserting a `NAME` attribute column.
. Use the next four rows to define the following elements as needed (rows 8-11 in example):
+
* *Rule attributes:* Conditions, actions, or other attributes.
* *Object types:* The data objects to which the rule attributes apply. If the same object type applies to multiple columns, merge the object cells into one cell across multiple columns (as shown in the sample decision table), instead of repeating the object type in multiple cells. When an object type is merged, all columns below the merged range will be combined into one set of constraints within a single pattern for matching a single fact at a time. When an object is repeated in separate columns, the separate columns can create different patterns, potentially matching different or identical facts.
* *Constraints:* Constraints on the object types.
* *Column label:* (Optional) Any descriptive label for the column, as a visual aid. Leave blank if unused.
+
NOTE: As an alternative to populating both the object type and constraint cells, you can leave the object type cell or cells empty and enter the full expression in the corresponding constraint cell or cells. For example, instead of `Order` as the object type and `itemsCount > $1` as a constraint (separate cells), you can leave the object type cell empty and enter `Order( itemsCount > $1 )` in the constraint cell, and then do the same for other constraint cells.

+
. After you have defined all necessary rule attributes (columns), enter values for each column as needed, row by row, to generate rules (rows 12-17 in example). Cells with no data are ignored (such as when a condition or action does not apply).
+
If you need to add more rule tables to this decision table spreadsheet, skip a row after the last rule in the previous table, label another `RuleTable` cell in the same column as the previous `RuleTable` and  `RuleSet` cells, and create the new table following the same steps in this section (rows 19-29 in example).
. Save your XLS or XLSX spreadsheet to finish.
. In your VSCode IDE, import the XLS or XLSX spreadsheet file in the relevant folder of your {PRODUCT} project, typically in `src/main/resources`.

NOTE: Only the first worksheet in a spreadsheet workbook is processed as a decision table when you include the spreadsheet in your {PRODUCT} project. Each `RuleSet` name combined with the `RuleTable` name must be unique across all decision table files in the same package.

// as we do not have spreadhseet editor in BAMO, probably not rendered, but translated,interpreted/....?
After you include the decision table in your {PRODUCT} project, the rules are rendered as DRL rules like the following example, from the sample spreadsheet:

----
//row 12
rule "Basic_12"
salience 10
  when
    $order : /orders[ itemsCount > 0, itemsCount <= 3, deliverInDays == 1 ]
  then
    insert( new Charge( 35 ) );
end
----

[NOTE]
.Enabling white space used in cell values
====
By default, any white space before or after values in decision table cells is removed before the decision table is processed by the decision engine. To retain white space that you use intentionally before or after values in cells, set the `drools.trimCellsInDTable` system property to `false` in the `application.properties` file of your {PRODUCT} project:

.Enable white space in `application.properties`
[source]
----
drools.trimCellsInDTable=false
----

You can also set this property as a start-up option when you build your {PRODUCT} project:

.On Quarkus
[source]
----
mvn compile quarkus:dev -Ddrools.trimCellsInDTable=false
----
====

=== RuleSet definitions

[role="_abstract"]
Entries in the `RuleSet` area of a decision table define DRL constructs and rule attributes that you want to apply to all rules in a package (not only in the spreadsheet). Entries must be in a vertically stacked sequence of cell pairs, where the first cell contains a label and the cell to the right contains the value. A decision table spreadsheet can have only one `RuleSet` area.

The following table lists the supported labels and values for `RuleSet` definitions:

.Supported `RuleSet` definitions
[cols="30%,40%,30%", options="header"]
|===
|Label |Value |Usage

|`RuleSet`
|The package name for the generated DRL file. Optional, the default is `rule_table`.
|Must be the first entry.

|`Unit`
|The name of the rule unit for the generated DRL file.
|Recommended for optimal rule grouping and execution.

|`Sequential`
|`true` or `false`. If `true`, then salience is used to ensure that rules fire from the top down.
|Optional, at most once. If omitted, no firing order is imposed.

|`SequentialMaxPriority`
|Integer numeric value.
|Optional, at most once. In sequential mode, this option is used to set the start value of the salience. If omitted, the default value is `65535`.

|`SequentialMinPriority`
|Integer numeric value.
|Optional, at most once. In sequential mode, this option is used to check if this minimum salience value is not violated. If omitted, the default value is `0`.

|`EscapeQuotes`
|`true` or `false`. If `true`, then quotation marks are escaped so that they appear literally in the DRL.
|Optional, at most once. If omitted, quotation marks are escaped.

|`Import`
|A comma-separated list of Java classes to import from another package.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.

|`Queries`
|One or more query definitions, according to DRL syntax.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.

|`Declare`
|One or more declarative types, according to DRL syntax.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.
|===

WARNING: In some cases, Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, and OpenOffice might encode a double quotation mark differently, causing a compilation error. For example, `"`A`"` fails, but `"A"` succeeds.

=== RuleTable definitions

[role="_abstract"]
Entries in the `RuleTable` area of a decision table define conditions, actions, and other rule attributes for the rules in that rule table. A spreadsheet of decision tables can contain multiple `RuleTable` areas.

The following table lists the supported labels (column headers) and values for `RuleTable` definitions. For column headers, you can use either the given labels or any custom labels that begin with the letters listed in the table.

.Supported `RuleTable` definitions
[cols="25%,20%,35%,20%", options="header"]
|===
|Label |Or custom label that begins with |Value |Usage

|`NAME`
|N
|Provides the name for the rule generated from that row. The default is constructed from the text following the `RuleTable` tag and the row number.
|At most one column.

|`DESCRIPTION`
|I
|Results in a comment within the generated rule.
|At most one column.

|`CONDITION`
|C
|Code snippet and interpolated values for constructing a constraint within a pattern in a condition.
|At least one per rule table.

|`ACTION`
|A
|Code snippet and interpolated values for constructing an action for the consequence of the rule.
|At least one per rule table.

|`METADATA`
|@
|Code snippet and interpolated values for constructing a metadata entry for the rule.
|Optional, any number of columns.
|===

The following sections provide more details about how condition, action, and metadata columns use cell data:

Conditions::

For columns headed `CONDITION`, the cells in consecutive lines result in a conditional element:

* *First cell:* Text in the first cell below `CONDITION` develops into a pattern for the rule condition, and uses the snippet in the next line as a constraint. If the cell is merged with one or more neighboring cells, a single pattern with multiple constraints is formed. All constraints are combined into a parenthesized list and appended to the text in this cell.
+
If this cell is empty, the code snippet in the cell below it must result in a valid conditional element on its own. For example, instead of `Order` as the object type and `itemsCount > $1` as a constraint (separate cells), you can leave the object type cell empty and enter `Order( itemsCount > $1 )` in the constraint cell, and then do the same for any other constraint cells.
+
To include a pattern without constraints, you can write the pattern in front of the text of another pattern, with or without an empty pair of parentheses. You can also append a `from` clause to the pattern.
+
If the pattern ends with `eval`, code snippets produce boolean expressions for inclusion into a pair of parentheses after `eval`.
* *Second cell:* Text in the second cell below `CONDITION` is processed as a constraint on the object reference in the first cell. The code snippet in this cell is modified by interpolating values from cells farther down in the column. If you want to create a constraint consisting of a comparison using `==` with the value from the cells below, then the field selector alone is sufficient. Any other comparison operator must be specified as the last item within the snippet, and the value from the cells below is appended. For all other constraint forms, you must mark the position for including the contents of a cell with the symbol `$param`. Multiple insertions are possible if you use the symbols `$1`, `$2`, and so on, and a comma-separated list of values in the cells below. However, do not separate `$1`, `$2`, and so on, by commas, or the table will fail to process.
+
To expand a text according to the pattern `forall($delimiter){$snippet}`, repeat the `$snippet` once for each of the values of the comma-separated list in each of the cells below, insert the value in place of the symbol `$`, and join these expansions by the given `$delimiter`. Note that the `forall` construct may be surrounded by other text.
+
If the first cell contains an object, the completed code snippet is added to the conditional element from that cell. A pair of parentheses is provided automatically, as well as a separating comma if multiple constraints are added to a pattern in a merged cell. If the first cell is empty, the code snippet in this cell must result in a valid conditional element on its own. For example, instead of `Order` as the object type and `itemsCount > $1` as a constraint (separate cells), you can leave the object type cell empty and enter `Order( itemsCount > $1 )` in the constraint cell, and then do the same for any other constraint cells.
* *Third cell:* Text in the third cell below `CONDITION` is a descriptive label that you define for the column, as a visual aid.
* *Fourth cell:* From the fourth row on, non-blank entries provide data for interpolation. A blank cell omits the condition or constraint for this rule.

Actions::

For columns headed `ACTION`, the cells in consecutive lines result in an action statement:

* *First cell:* Text in the first cell below `ACTION` is optional. If present, the text is interpreted as an object reference.
* *Second cell:* Text in the second cell below `ACTION` is a code snippet that is modified by interpolating values from cells farther down in the column. For a singular insertion, mark the position for including the contents of a cell with the symbol `$param`. Multiple insertions are possible if you use the symbols `$1`, `$2`, and so on, and a comma-separated list of values in the cells below. However, do not separate `$1`, `$2`, and so on, by commas, or the table will fail to process.
+
A text without any marker symbols can execute a method call without interpolation. In this case, use any non-blank entry in a row below the cell to include the statement. The `forall` construct is supported.
+
If the first cell contains an object, then the cell text (followed by a period), the text in the second cell, and a terminating semicolon are strung together, resulting in a method call that is added as an action statement for the consequence. If the first cell is empty, the code snippet in this cell must result in a valid action element on its own.
* *Third cell:* Text in the third cell below `ACTION` is a descriptive label that you define for the column, as a visual aid.
* *Fourth cell:* From the fourth row on, non-blank entries provide data for interpolation. A blank cell omits the condition or constraint for this rule.

Metadata::

For columns headed `METADATA`, the cells in consecutive lines result in a metadata annotation for the generated rules:

* *First cell:* Text in the first cell below `METADATA` is ignored.
* *Second cell:* Text in the second cell below `METADATA` is subject to interpolation, using values from the cells in the rule rows. The metadata marker character `@` is prefixed automatically, so you do not need to include that character in the text for this cell.
* *Third cell:* Text in the third cell below `METADATA` is a descriptive label that you define for the column, as a visual aid.
* *Fourth cell:* From the fourth row on, non-blank entries provide data for interpolation. A blank cell results in the omission of the metadata annotation for this rule.

=== Additional rule attributes for RuleSet or RuleTable definitions

[role="_abstract"]
The `RuleSet` and `RuleTable` areas also support labels and values for other rule attributes, such as `PRIORITY` or `NO-LOOP`. Rule attributes specified in a `RuleSet` area will affect all rule assets in the same package (not only in the spreadsheet). Rule attributes specified in a `RuleTable` area will affect only the rules in that rule table. You can use each rule attribute only once in a `RuleSet` area and once in a `RuleTable` area. If the same attribute is used in both `RuleSet` and `RuleTable` areas within the spreadsheet, then `RuleTable` takes priority and the attribute in the `RuleSet` area is overridden.

The following table lists the supported labels (column headers) and values for additional `RuleSet` or `RuleTable` definitions. For column headers, you can use either the given labels or any custom labels that begin with the letters listed in the table.

.Additional rule attributes for `RuleSet` or `RuleTable` definitions
[cols="25%,20%,55%", options="header"]
|===
|Label
|Or custom label that begins with
|Value

|`PRIORITY`
|P
|An integer defining the `salience` value of the rule. Rules with a higher salience value are given higher priority when ordered in the activation queue. Overridden by the `Sequential` flag.

Example: `PRIORITY 10`

|`DATE-EFFECTIVE`
|V
|A string containing a date and time definition. The rule can be activated only if the current date and time is after a `DATE-EFFECTIVE` attribute.

Example: `DATE-EFFECTIVE "4-Sep-2018"`

|`DATE-EXPIRES`
|Z
|A string containing a date and time definition. The rule cannot be activated if the current date and time is after the `DATE-EXPIRES` attribute.

Example: `DATE-EXPIRES "4-Oct-2018"`

|`NO-LOOP`
|U
|A Boolean value. When this option is set to `true`, the rule cannot be reactivated (looped) if a consequence of the rule re-triggers a previously met condition.

Example: `NO-LOOP true`

|`ACTIVATION-GROUP`
|X
|A string identifying an activation (or XOR) group to which you want to assign the rule. In activation groups, only one rule can be activated. The first rule to fire will cancel all pending activations of all rules in the activation group.

Example: `ACTIVATION-GROUP "GroupName"`

|`DURATION`
|D
|A long integer value defining the duration of time in milliseconds after which the rule can be activated, if the rule conditions are still met.

Example: `DURATION 10000`

|`TIMER`
|T
|A string identifying either `int` (interval) or `cron` timer definitions for scheduling the rule.

Example: `TIMER "*/5 * * * *"`  (every 5 minutes)

|`CALENDAR`
|E
|A Quartz calendar definition for scheduling the rule.

Example: `CALENDAR "* * 0-7,18-23 ? * *"`  (exclude non-business hours)

|`AUTO-FOCUS`
|F
|A Boolean value, applicable only to rules within agenda groups. When this option is set to `true`, the next time the rule is activated, a focus is automatically given to the agenda group to which the rule is assigned.

Example: `AUTO-FOCUS true`

|`LOCK-ON-ACTIVE`
|L
|A Boolean value, applicable only to rules within rule flow groups or agenda groups. When this option is set to `true`, the next time the ruleflow group for the rule becomes active or the agenda group for the rule receives a focus, the rule cannot be activated again until the ruleflow group is no longer active or the agenda group loses the focus. This is a stronger version of the `no-loop` attribute, because the activation of a matching rule is discarded regardless of the origin of the update (not only by the rule itself). This attribute is ideal for calculation rules where you have a number of rules that modify a fact and you do not want any rule re-matching and firing again.

Example: `LOCK-ON-ACTIVE true`

* *Object types:* The data objects to which the rule attributes apply. If the same object type applies to multiple columns, merge the object cells into one cell across multiple columns (as shown in the sample decision table), instead of repeating the object type in multiple cells. When an object type is merged, all columns below the merged range will be combined into one set of constraints within a single pattern for matching a single fact at a time. When an object is repeated in separate columns, the separate columns can create different patterns, potentially matching different or identical facts.
* *Constraints:* Constraints on the object types.
* *Column label:* (Optional) Any descriptive label for the column, as a visual aid. Leave blank if unused.
+
NOTE: As an alternative to populating both the object type and constraint cells, you can leave the object type cell or cells empty and enter the full expression in the corresponding constraint cell or cells. For example, instead of `Order` as the object type and `itemsCount > $1` as a constraint (separate cells), you can leave the object type cell empty and enter `Order( itemsCount > $1 )` in the constraint cell, and then do the same for other constraint cells.

+
. After you have defined all necessary rule attributes (columns), enter values for each column as needed, row by row, to generate rules (rows 12-17 in example). Cells with no data are ignored (such as when a condition or action does not apply).
+
If you need to add more rule tables to this decision table spreadsheet, skip a row after the last rule in the previous table, label another `RuleTable` cell in the same column as the previous `RuleTable` and  `RuleSet` cells, and create the new table following the same steps in this section (rows 19-29 in example).
. Save your XLS or XLSX spreadsheet to finish.
. In your VSCode IDE, import the XLS or XLSX spreadsheet file in the relevant folder of your {PRODUCT} project, typically in `src/main/resources`.

NOTE: Only the first worksheet in a spreadsheet workbook is processed as a decision table when you include the spreadsheet in your {PRODUCT} project. Each `RuleSet` name combined with the `RuleTable` name must be unique across all decision table files in the same package.

After you include the decision table in your {PRODUCT} project, the rules are rendered as DRL rules like the following example, from the sample spreadsheet:

----
//row 12
rule "Basic_12"
salience 10
  when
    $order : /orders[ itemsCount > 0, itemsCount <= 3, deliverInDays == 1 ]
  then
    insert( new Charge( 35 ) );
end
----

[NOTE]
.Enabling white space used in cell values
====
By default, any white space before or after values in decision table cells is removed before the decision table is processed by the decision engine. To retain white space that you use intentionally before or after values in cells, set the `drools.trimCellsInDTable` system property to `false` in the `application.properties` file of your {PRODUCT} project:

.Enable white space in `application.properties`
[source]
----
drools.trimCellsInDTable=false
----

You can also set this property as a start-up option when you build your {PRODUCT} project:

.On Quarkus
[source]
----
mvn compile quarkus:dev -Ddrools.trimCellsInDTable=false
----

=== RuleSet definitions

[role="_abstract"]
Entries in the `RuleSet` area of a decision table define DRL constructs and rule attributes that you want to apply to all rules in a package (not only in the spreadsheet). Entries must be in a vertically stacked sequence of cell pairs, where the first cell contains a label and the cell to the right contains the value. A decision table spreadsheet can have only one `RuleSet` area.

The following table lists the supported labels and values for `RuleSet` definitions:

.Supported `RuleSet` definitions
[cols="30%,40%,30%", options="header"]
|===
|Label |Value |Usage

|`RuleSet`
|The package name for the generated DRL file. Optional, the default is `rule_table`.
|Must be the first entry.

|`Unit`
|The name of the rule unit for the generated DRL file.
|Recommended for optimal rule grouping and execution.

|`Sequential`
|`true` or `false`. If `true`, then salience is used to ensure that rules fire from the top down.
|Optional, at most once. If omitted, no firing order is imposed.

|`SequentialMaxPriority`
|Integer numeric value.
|Optional, at most once. In sequential mode, this option is used to set the start value of the salience. If omitted, the default value is `65535`.

|`SequentialMinPriority`
|Integer numeric value.
|Optional, at most once. In sequential mode, this option is used to check if this minimum salience value is not violated. If omitted, the default value is `0`.

|`EscapeQuotes`
|`true` or `false`. If `true`, then quotation marks are escaped so that they appear literally in the DRL.
|Optional, at most once. If omitted, quotation marks are escaped.

|`Import`
|A comma-separated list of Java classes to import from another package.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.

|`Queries`
|One or more query definitions, according to DRL syntax.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.

|`Declare`
|One or more declarative types, according to DRL syntax.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.
|===

WARNING: In some cases, Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, and OpenOffice might encode a double quotation mark differently, causing a compilation error. For example, `"`A`"` fails, but `"A"` succeeds.

=== RuleTable definitions

[role="_abstract"]
Entries in the `RuleTable` area of a decision table define conditions, actions, and other rule attributes for the rules in that rule table. A spreadsheet of decision tables can contain multiple `RuleTable` areas.

The following table lists the supported labels (column headers) and values for `RuleTable` definitions. For column headers, you can use either the given labels or any custom labels that begin with the letters listed in the table.

.Supported `RuleTable` definitions
[cols="25%,20%,35%,20%", options="header"]
|===
|Label |Or custom label that begins with |Value |Usage

|`NAME`
|N
|Provides the name for the rule generated from that row. The default is constructed from the text following the `RuleTable` tag and the row number.
|At most one column.

|`DESCRIPTION`
|I
|Results in a comment within the generated rule.
|At most one column.

|`CONDITION`
|C
|Code snippet and interpolated values for constructing a constraint within a pattern in a condition.
|At least one per rule table.

|`ACTION`
|A
|Code snippet and interpolated values for constructing an action for the consequence of the rule.
|At least one per rule table.

|`METADATA`
|@
|Code snippet and interpolated values for constructing a metadata entry for the rule.
|Optional, any number of columns.
|===

The following sections provide more details about how condition, action, and metadata columns use cell data:

Conditions::

For columns headed `CONDITION`, the cells in consecutive lines result in a conditional element:

* *First cell:* Text in the first cell below `CONDITION` develops into a pattern for the rule condition, and uses the snippet in the next line as a constraint. If the cell is merged with one or more neighboring cells, a single pattern with multiple constraints is formed. All constraints are combined into a parenthesized list and appended to the text in this cell.
+
If this cell is empty, the code snippet in the cell below it must result in a valid conditional element on its own. For example, instead of `Order` as the object type and `itemsCount > $1` as a constraint (separate cells), you can leave the object type cell empty and enter `Order( itemsCount > $1 )` in the constraint cell, and then do the same for any other constraint cells.
+
To include a pattern without constraints, you can write the pattern in front of the text of another pattern, with or without an empty pair of parentheses. You can also append a `from` clause to the pattern.
+
If the pattern ends with `eval`, code snippets produce boolean expressions for inclusion into a pair of parentheses after `eval`.
* *Second cell:* Text in the second cell below `CONDITION` is processed as a constraint on the object reference in the first cell. The code snippet in this cell is modified by interpolating values from cells farther down in the column. If you want to create a constraint consisting of a comparison using `==` with the value from the cells below, then the field selector alone is sufficient. Any other comparison operator must be specified as the last item within the snippet, and the value from the cells below is appended. For all other constraint forms, you must mark the position for including the contents of a cell with the symbol `$param`. Multiple insertions are possible if you use the symbols `$1`, `$2`, and so on, and a comma-separated list of values in the cells below. However, do not separate `$1`, `$2`, and so on, by commas, or the table will fail to process.
+
To expand a text according to the pattern `forall($delimiter){$snippet}`, repeat the `$snippet` once for each of the values of the comma-separated list in each of the cells below, insert the value in place of the symbol `$`, and join these expansions by the given `$delimiter`. Note that the `forall` construct may be surrounded by other text.
+
If the first cell contains an object, the completed code snippet is added to the conditional element from that cell. A pair of parentheses is provided automatically, as well as a separating comma if multiple constraints are added to a pattern in a merged cell. If the first cell is empty, the code snippet in this cell must result in a valid conditional element on its own. For example, instead of `Order` as the object type and `itemsCount > $1` as a constraint (separate cells), you can leave the object type cell empty and enter `Order( itemsCount > $1 )` in the constraint cell, and then do the same for any other constraint cells.
* *Third cell:* Text in the third cell below `CONDITION` is a descriptive label that you define for the column, as a visual aid.
* *Fourth cell:* From the fourth row on, non-blank entries provide data for interpolation. A blank cell omits the condition or constraint for this rule.

Actions::

For columns headed `ACTION`, the cells in consecutive lines result in an action statement:

* *First cell:* Text in the first cell below `ACTION` is optional. If present, the text is interpreted as an object reference.
* *Second cell:* Text in the second cell below `ACTION` is a code snippet that is modified by interpolating values from cells farther down in the column. For a singular insertion, mark the position for including the contents of a cell with the symbol `$param`. Multiple insertions are possible if you use the symbols `$1`, `$2`, and so on, and a comma-separated list of values in the cells below. However, do not separate `$1`, `$2`, and so on, by commas, or the table will fail to process.
+
A text without any marker symbols can execute a method call without interpolation. In this case, use any non-blank entry in a row below the cell to include the statement. The `forall` construct is supported.
+
If the first cell contains an object, then the cell text (followed by a period), the text in the second cell, and a terminating semicolon are strung together, resulting in a method call that is added as an action statement for the consequence. If the first cell is empty, the code snippet in this cell must result in a valid action element on its own.
* *Third cell:* Text in the third cell below `ACTION` is a descriptive label that you define for the column, as a visual aid.
* *Fourth cell:* From the fourth row on, non-blank entries provide data for interpolation. A blank cell omits the condition or constraint for this rule.

Metadata::

For columns headed `METADATA`, the cells in consecutive lines result in a metadata annotation for the generated rules:

* *First cell:* Text in the first cell below `METADATA` is ignored.
* *Second cell:* Text in the second cell below `METADATA` is subject to interpolation, using values from the cells in the rule rows. The metadata marker character `@` is prefixed automatically, so you do not need to include that character in the text for this cell.
* *Third cell:* Text in the third cell below `METADATA` is a descriptive label that you define for the column, as a visual aid.
* *Fourth cell:* From the fourth row on, non-blank entries provide data for interpolation. A blank cell results in the omission of the metadata annotation for this rule.

=== Additional rule attributes for RuleSet or RuleTable definitions

[role="_abstract"]
The `RuleSet` and `RuleTable` areas also support labels and values for other rule attributes, such as `PRIORITY` or `NO-LOOP`. Rule attributes specified in a `RuleSet` area will affect all rule assets in the same package (not only in the spreadsheet). Rule attributes specified in a `RuleTable` area will affect only the rules in that rule table. You can use each rule attribute only once in a `RuleSet` area and once in a `RuleTable` area. If the same attribute is used in both `RuleSet` and `RuleTable` areas within the spreadsheet, then `RuleTable` takes priority and the attribute in the `RuleSet` area is overridden.

The following table lists the supported labels (column headers) and values for additional `RuleSet` or `RuleTable` definitions. For column headers, you can use either the given labels or any custom labels that begin with the letters listed in the table.

.Additional rule attributes for `RuleSet` or `RuleTable` definitions
[cols="25%,20%,55%", options="header"]
|===
|Label
|Or custom label that begins with
|Value

|`PRIORITY`
|P
|An integer defining the `salience` value of the rule. Rules with a higher salience value are given higher priority when ordered in the activation queue. Overridden by the `Sequential` flag.

Example: `PRIORITY 10`

|`DATE-EFFECTIVE`
|V
|A string containing a date and time definition. The rule can be activated only if the current date and time is after a `DATE-EFFECTIVE` attribute.

Example: `DATE-EFFECTIVE "4-Sep-2018"`

|`DATE-EXPIRES`
|Z
|A string containing a date and time definition. The rule cannot be activated if the current date and time is after the `DATE-EXPIRES` attribute.

Example: `DATE-EXPIRES "4-Oct-2018"`

|`NO-LOOP`
|U
|A Boolean value. When this option is set to `true`, the rule cannot be reactivated (looped) if a consequence of the rule re-triggers a previously met condition.

Example: `NO-LOOP true`

|`ACTIVATION-GROUP`
|X
|A string identifying an activation (or XOR) group to which you want to assign the rule. In activation groups, only one rule can be activated. The first rule to fire will cancel all pending activations of all rules in the activation group.

Example: `ACTIVATION-GROUP "GroupName"`

|`DURATION`
|D
|A long integer value defining the duration of time in milliseconds after which the rule can be activated, if the rule conditions are still met.

Example: `DURATION 10000`

|`TIMER`
|T
|A string identifying either `int` (interval) or `cron` timer definitions for scheduling the rule.

Example: `TIMER "*/5 * * * *"`  (every 5 minutes)

|`CALENDAR`
|E
|A Quartz calendar definition for scheduling the rule.

Example: `CALENDAR "* * 0-7,18-23 ? * *"`  (exclude non-business hours)

|`AUTO-FOCUS`
|F
|A Boolean value, applicable only to rules within agenda groups. When this option is set to `true`, the next time the rule is activated, a focus is automatically given to the agenda group to which the rule is assigned.

Example: `AUTO-FOCUS true`

|`LOCK-ON-ACTIVE`
|L
|A Boolean value, applicable only to rules within rule flow groups or agenda groups. When this option is set to `true`, the next time the ruleflow group for the rule becomes active or the agenda group for the rule receives a focus, the rule cannot be activated again until the ruleflow group is no longer active or the agenda group loses the focus. This is a stronger version of the `no-loop` attribute, because the activation of a matching rule is discarded regardless of the origin of the update (not only by the rule itself). This attribute is ideal for calculation rules where you have a number of rules that modify a fact and you do not want any rule re-matching and firing again.

Example: `LOCK-ON-ACTIVE true`

== {PRODUCT} service execution

[role="_abstract"]
After you design your {PRODUCT} service, you can build and run your application and then send REST API requests to the application to execute your services. The exact REST API requests that you can use depend on how you set up the application.

For example, consider a {PRODUCT} service that is set up to generate a `/persons` REST API endpoint and determines whether a specified customer is an adult or is underage. In this example, you can send the following `POST` request using a REST client or curl utility to add an adult and execute the service:

.Example POST request body to add an adult (JSON)
[source,json]
----
{
  "person": {
    "name": "John Quark",
    "age": 20
  }
}
----

.Example curl command to add an adult
[source]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/persons -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json' -d '{"person": {"name":"John Quark", "age": 20}}'
----

.Example response (JSON)
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "3af806dd-8819-4734-a934-728f4c819682",
  "person": {
    "name": "John Quark",
    "age": 20,
    "adult": false
  },
  "isAdult": true
}
----

Note that for JSON marshaling, {PRODUCT} is relying on the default mappers of https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-json#jackson[Quarkus], which can be configured according to the specific requirements.
