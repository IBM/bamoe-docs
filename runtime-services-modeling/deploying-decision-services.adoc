= Deploying Decision Services 
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

== Running the {PRODUCT} decision example applications

[role="_abstract"]
To get started with {PRODUCT}, you can run any of the example applications in the bamoe-{VERSION}-kogito-examples.zip archive and experiment with the {PRODUCT} services.

For this procedure, use the `process-decisions-quarkus` application. You can follow similar steps with the other {PRODUCT} examples on Quarkus.

In the `process-decisions-quarkus` applications, the `traffic-rules-dmn.bpmn` process describes the steps that need to be followed when verifying a driver's potential suspension.
The process includes a service node to call to a Java service `DriverService.java` that is used to fetch information about a driver using a custom `Driver` object, Business Rule nodes to call decisions defined in `DMN` and `DRL` format as well as script tasks for writing debug information.

.Example `traffic-rules-dmn.bpmn` process
image::traffic-rules-dmn.png[Image of `traffic-rules-dmn.bpmn` example process]

The traffic violations process contains license validation as a decision that is created using DRL. The license validation consists of rules that are evaluated to verify that the license is expired or not. The result of the license validation is added for the driver variable. The rule units are declared in the `LicenseValidationService.drl` file and the rule unit data is added to the `LicenseValidationService` class.

Example `LicenseValidationService.drl` file:
[source]
----
unit LicenseValidationService

rule "Is driver license valid"
when
    $driver: /driver[licenseExpiration.after(currentTime)]
then
    $driver.setValidLicense(true);
end

rule "Is driver license expired"
when
    $driver: /driver[licenseExpiration.before(currentTime)]
then
    $driver.setValidLicense(false);
end

query "validation"
  $driver : /driver
end
----

Example `LicenseValidationService` class:
[source,java]
----
public class LicenseValidationService implements RuleUnitData {
    private SingletonStore<Driver> driver;

    public LicenseValidationService() {
        this(DataSource.createSingleton());
    }

    public LicenseValidationService(SingletonStore<Driver> driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }

    public void setDriver(SingletonStore<Driver> driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }

    public SingletonStore<Driver> getDriver() {
        return driver;
    }

    public Date getCurrentTime() {
        return new Date();
    }
}
----

After the license validation task, the traffic violations process contains traffic violation as a decision that is created using DMN. The traffic violation decision verifies whether the driver is suspended or not based on the points in the driver’s license.

The traffic violation decision is declared in the `TrafficViolation.dmn` file.

.Example `TrafficViolation.dmn` file
image::traffic-violation-dmn.png[Image of traffic TrafficViolation.dmn file]

Based on this process, this example service exposes REST operations to create new traffic incidents, to list and delete active traffic incidents, and to invoke the license validation service endpoint.

.Procedure
. Download the bamoe-{VERSION}-kogito-examples.zip archive to a local directory and extract the file.
. In a command terminal, navigate to the extracted `kogito-quarkus-examples/process-decisions-quarkus` folder, and enter one of the following commands to build and run the example.

Quarkus support the following run modes:

* *Development mode*: For local testing. On Quarkus, development mode also offers live reload of your processes and decisions in your running applications for advanced debugging.
* *JVM mode*: For compatibility with a Java virtual machine (JVM).
* *Native mode*: (Quarkus only, requires GraalVM or Mandrel) For direct binary execution as native code.

The command that you use depends on your preferred run mode and application environment:

* For development mode:
+
.On Quarkus
[source]
----
$ mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
----
+
* For JVM mode:
+
.On Quarkus
[source]
----
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----
+
* For native mode (requires GraalVM or Mandrel):
+
.On Quarkus only
[source]
----
$ mvn clean package -Dnative
$ ./target/process-decisions-quarkus-runner
----

. After the {PRODUCT} service is running, use a REST client, curl utility, or the Swagger UI configured for the application - http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui - to send API requests with the following components:


* *URL*: `\http://localhost:8080/`
* *HTTP headers*: For `POST` and `PUT` requests only:
** `accept`: `application/json`
** `content-type`: `application/json`
* *HTTP methods*: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` or `DELETE`

=== {PRODUCT} messaging add-on

{PRODUCT} provides a messaging add-on, enabling a process to register an event listener. The messaging add-on uses events in the {PRODUCT} projects. 

To configure messaging capabilities for your Kogito services, you must add the messaging add-on as a dependency in the `pom.xml` file of your Kogito project:

.Project dependency to enable messaging operations in Quarkus projects
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-messaging</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

For Quarkus, the {PRODUCT} process event add-on implementation is based on https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging/smallrye-reactive-messaging/2/connectors/connectors.html[Smallrye Messaging] library, which provides a set of connectors for event brokers, such as JMS, AMQP, and Kafka. Therefore, the {PRODUCT} process event add-on is not specifically combined with any event broker, but also requires additional configuration to use a suitable Smallrye connector.

For example, to use Kafka as an event broker in Quarkus, you must add the following dependency in the `pom.xml` file of your {PRODUCT} project:

.Project dependency to enable event broker in Quarkus
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
   <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Smallrye uses an abstraction named `channel`. The implementation of channels depends on the underlying event broker. For example, when using Kafka, every channel is mapped to a topic. 

Channels are configured by using properties. The pattern for these properties is `mp.messaging.[incoming|outgoing].<channel name>.<property_name>`.

{PRODUCT} allows different channel mapping strategies:

* Define one default incoming channel to receive all the incoming messages and one default outgoing channel to store all the published messages.
* Define a channel for each message name so that every message type has a dedicated channel.
* Define a channel for certain message names and let the not mapped message names to use the default incoming or outgoing channel. 

{PRODUCT} first searches for channel name equals to message name in the properties. If found, it uses that channel for that message name. If not, it searches for default channel definition. If also not existing, then an error will be reported. 

The name for the default incoming channel is `kogito_incoming_stream` and for the default outgoing channel is `kogito_outgoing_stream`. 

You can change the default incoming and outgoing topic name as follows:

.Quarkus
[source]
----
kogito.addon.messaging.incoming.defaultName=<default channel name>
kogito.addon.messaging.outgoing.defaultName=<default channel name>
----

Optionally, for Kafka connector, you can define the Kafka topic to be used for that channel using the following form:

`mp.messaging.[incoming|outgoing].<channel name>.topic = <topic name>`

If the topic property is not found, then the topic name is considered to be the same as Kafka name. Note that you can map different channels to the same topic, if you wish to do so. 

==== Providing a key for a Kafka record

To specify the key to your Kafka record, you can use a custom https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-runtimes/blob/main/quarkus/addons/common/reactive-messaging/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/addon/quarkus/common/reactive/messaging/MessageDecorator.java[MessageDecorator] implementation. 

For an example, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-examples/blob/main/kogito-quarkus-examples/process-kafka-avro-multi-quarkus/src/main/java/org/acme/travel/StringKeyDecorator.java[StringKeyDecorator.java]

==== Customizing message format

By default, {PRODUCT} uses Cloud event JSON format for messaging. However, you can change the default format by providing your own https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-runtimes/blob/main/api/kogito-events-api/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/event/EventMarshaller.java[event marshaler] implementation. 
For an example, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-runtimes/blob/main/addons/common/marshallers/avro/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/event/avro/AvroEventMarshaller.java[AvroEventMarshaller.java example]

=== {PRODUCT} Knative Eventing add-on

The Knative Eventing add-on is used in the {PRODUCT} project for messaging. The https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-runtimes/tree/main/addons/common/knative/eventing[{PRODUCT} Knative Eventing] add-on enables your project to connect to a https://knative.dev/docs/developer/eventing/sinks/[sink] or make it a https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kogito#kogito-source[KogitoSource].

The add-on processes the https://knative.dev/development/developer/eventing/sources/sinkbinding/[`K_SINK`] and https://knative.dev/development/developer/eventing/sources/sinkbinding/reference/#cloudevent-overrides[`K_CE_OVERRIDES`] environment variables injected by Knative Eventing controllers (`SinkBinding` or `KogitoSource`).

The service requires the https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-runtimes/tree/main/addons/common/messaging[{PRODUCT} Messaging] and https://quarkus.io/guides/reactive-messaging-http.html[Quarkus HTTP connector] libraries to wire the {PRODUCT} service with a given sink. The {PRODUCT} Messaging and Quarkus HTTP connector perform as dependencies for the Knative Eventing add-on.


To use the Knative Eventing add-on, add the following code to the `pom.xml` file of your project:

.Quarkus
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-knative-eventing</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

==== Auto-generated Knative resources

The Knative Eventing add-on can generate Knative Eventing resources by inspecting your BPMN or Serverless Workflow files for event definitions. 

To enable the auto-generation of Knative resources, add the following dependency to your project:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-kubernetes</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

After adding the previous dependency, the add-on generates Knative Eventing resources to handle the events that are produced or consumed by your BPMN or Serverless Workflow resources on Knative Eventing platform.

For each consumed event, the add-on generates a https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/broker/triggers/[Knative Eventing Trigger] as shown in the following example:

.Example Knative `Trigger` custom resource for a {PRODUCT} service with `Broker` binding
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: travellers-trigger-process-knative-quickstart-quarkus
spec:
  broker: default
  filter:
    attributes:
      type: travellers
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: process-knative-quickstart-quarkus
----

The `Trigger` resource requires a subscriber to receive the events that are routed by the `Broker`. In this case, the current {PRODUCT} service work as a subscriber, and the Knative Eventing add-on uses the {PRODUCT} service deployment, which is configured by Quarkus Kubernetes.

If a `Broker` is not specified, the Knative Eventing add-on generates a default `InMemoryChannel` as follows:

.Example `Broker` custom resource for Knative Eventing with default `InMemoryChannel`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: default
----

If a `Broker` is configured in the target namespace, you can specify the `Broker` using the following property:
`org.kie.kogito.addons.knative.eventing.broker=myKafkaBroker`.

If the {PRODUCT} service contains any produced event definitions, the Knative Eventing add-on generates a https://knative.dev/development/eventing/custom-event-source/sinkbinding/[Knative Eventing `SinkBinding`], or a https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kogito#kogito-source[Knative Eventing `KogitoSource`]. By default, the `SinkBinding` is generated, but you can change this behavior by setting `org.kie.kogito.addons.knative.eventing.generate-kogito-source` property to `true`.

.Example `SinkBinding` custom resource for Knative Eventing

      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Broker
      name: default
  subject:
    apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
    kind: Service
    name: process-knative-quickstart-quarkus
----

.Example `KogitoSource` custom resource for Knative Eventing

      namespace: ""
  subject:
    apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
    kind: Service
    name: process-knative-quickstart-quarkus
----

The target deployment defined in the Quarkus Kubernetes plugin work as the subject for `SinkBinding` and `KogitoSource`. You can configure the `sink` using the application properties. By default, the generated `Broker` is defined as the `sink`.

The following table lists all the available properties for the Knative Eventing add-on:

=== {PRODUCT} events add-on

The events add-on provides a default implementation in supported target platforms for EventEmitter and EventReceiver interfaces. You can use EventEmitter and EventReceiver interfaces to enable messaging by process, serverless workflow events, and event decision handling. 

==== Implementing message payload decorator
Any dependant add-on can implement the https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-runtimes/blob/main/addons/common/messaging/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/addon/cloudevents/message/MessagePayloadDecorator.java[MessagePayloadDecorator].

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the Events add-on in {PRODUCT}.

.Procedure
. Create a file named `META-INF/services/org.kie.kogito.add-on.cloudevents.message.MessagePayloadDecorator` in your class path.
. Open the file.
. Enter the full name of your implementation class in the file.
. Save the file.

The `MessagePayloadDecoratorProvider` loads the file upon application startup and adds the file to the decoration chain. When {PRODUCT} calls the https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-runtimes/blob/main/addons/common/messaging/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/addon/cloudevents/message/MessagePayloadDecoratorProvider.java[MessagePayloadDecoratorProvider#decorate], your implementation is part of the decoration algorithm.

=== {PRODUCT} process management add-on

[role="_abstract"]
{PRODUCT} provides a `kogito-addons-quarkus-process-management` add-on that enables basic REST operations that you can use to manage process instances. These REST operations are supplemental to any other specific REST operations that you have configured in your application.

To configure process management REST capabilities for your {PRODUCT} services, you can add the process management add-on as a dependency in the `pom.xml` file of your {PRODUCT} project:

.Project dependency to enable process management REST operations
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-process-management</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The {PRODUCT} process management add-on provides REST support for the following basic operations:

* *Process instances*: Abort an active process instance
* *Node instances*:  Cancel or re-trigger a node instance, or trigger a new node instance
* *Error handling*: Retrieve error details for a process instance, or skip or re-trigger a failed node instance

In addition to exposed REST operations, the process management add-on also provides the following REST exception mappers to generate more meaningful error messages for typical exception types:

* `ProcessInstanceNotFound`
* `NodeInstanceNotFound`
* `NodeNotFound`
* `ProcessInstanceExecutionError`
* `NotAuthorized`
* `InvalidTransition` (for work items)
* `InvalidLifeCyclePhase` (for work items)

These exception mappers produce a valid HTTP error code with JSON payload with the context that caused the exception.

For example, the following is a `ProcessInstanceNotFoundException` error generated at runtime:

.Example error with JSON payload at runtime
[source,json]
----
HTTP code : 404

{
  "processInstanceId" : "c6862071-0f2e-4f21-9bc8-586245a76c3aa",
  "message" : "Process instance with id c6862071-0f2e-4f21-9bc8-586245a76c3aa not found"

=== {PRODUCT} process SVG add-on

[role="_abstract"]
{PRODUCT} provides an add-on named `process-svg-addon`, enabling the basic REST operations that you can use to visualize the process diagram and execution path of the related process instances. The REST operations are supplemental to any other specific REST operation that is configured in your application.

The add-on requires the access of process SVG files. The process SVG files can be placed in a file system, which is accessible to the service or available in `META-INF/processSVG/` folder in the class path. For example, when the SVG files are generated, rename the files to `\{processId\}.svg`. The `\{processId\}.svg` file is used by the add-on and placed in a file system folder (accessible by the service) or in `META-INF/processSVG` folder in the class path. The configuration property `kogito.svg.folder.path` of the add-on points to the file system folder, otherwise the files are searched in the class path.

The VSCode extension enables you to export the process to SVG format:

.Export process diagram at VSCode
image::kogito/bpmn/kogito-svg-addon-manually-export.png[Manually export to SVG at VSCode]

[NOTE]
====
When you export a process to SVG format, the generated SVG is named to \{processFileName\}-svg.svg.
====

The process code generation searches this export and, if this file exists, copies and renames it to `META-INF/processSVG/\{processId\}.svg allowing the process SVG addon to consume it directly.

To configure process SVG REST capabilities for your {PRODUCT} services, you can add the process SVG add-on as a dependency in the `pom.xml` file of your {PRODUCT} project:

.Project dependency to enable process SVG REST operations in Quarkus projects
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-process-svg</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The process SVG add-on provides the following set of configuration properties:

The {PRODUCT} process SVG add-on provides REST support for the following basic operations:

* *Process Diagram*: Return the process SVG diagram
* *Process instance diagram*: Return the process SVG diagram displaying the executed path of a specific process instance
////

=== {PRODUCT} process event add-on

{PRODUCT} provides a process event add-on, which you can use to send processes, tasks, and variable events to an external event listener. In this case, the processes, tasks, and variable events are generated as a result of the execution of an operation, which modifies a process state; such events are known as runtime events.

In {PRODUCT}, every modifying operation is executed within an abstraction called a unit of work. Examples of such operations include creating a process instance, transitioning a task, and modifying a variable. A runtime event is published when a unit of work is completed.

You can use the {PRODUCT} process event add-on to build a historical representation of all process instance executions. Also, you can use this add-on with process REST API to build a custom graphical user interface to handle the user tasks.

By default, the event format follows the https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvent] specification, sending information using the data field.
The data field contains a JSON of one of the following types:

* https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-runtimes/blob/main/api/kogito-events-api/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/event/process/ProcessInstanceEventMetadata.java[ProcessInstanceEvent]: This event is published when a process instance is created, modified, or completed.
// * https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-runtimes/blob/main/api/kogito-events-api/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/event/usertask/UserTaskInstanceEventMetadata.java[UserTaskInstanceEvent]: This event is published when a change occurs on a user task.
* https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-runtimes/blob/main/api/kogito-events-api/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/event/process/ProcessInstanceVariableEventBody.java[VariableInstanceEvent]: This event is published when a variable is created, modified, or removed.

To configure process event capabilities for your {PRODUCT} services, you can add the process event add-on as a dependency in the `pom.xml` file of your {PRODUCT} project:

.Project dependency to enable process event operations in Quarkus projects
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-events-process</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

For Quarkus, the {PRODUCT} process event add-on implementation is based on https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging/smallrye-reactive-messaging/2/connectors/connectors.html[Smallrye Messaging] library, which provides a set of connectors for event brokers, such as JMS, AMQP, and Kafka. Therefore, the {PRODUCT} process event add-on is not specifically combined with any event broker in Quarkus, but requires additional configuration to use a suitable Smallrye connector.

For example, to use Kafka as an event broker in Quarkus, you can add the following dependency in the `pom.xml` file of your {PRODUCT} project:

.Project dependency to enable Kafka event broker in Quarkus
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
 <dependency>
  	<groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  	<artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Smallrye defines an abstraction named channel to enable multi-broker support. For every channel that you define in your {PRODUCT} application, you can specify the connector to use for that channel using the following form:

`mp.messaging.[incoming|outgoing].<channel name>.connector = <connector name>`

Optionally, for Kafka connector, you can define the Kafka topic to be used for that channel using the following form:

`mp.messaging.[incoming|outgoing].<channel name>.topic = <topic name>`

You can also set up a channel property using the following form:

`mp.messaging.[incoming|outgoing].<channel name>.<property name>= <property value>`

IMPORTANT: If the defined property is not found, then the topic name is considered to be the same as Kafka name.

The {PRODUCT} process event add-on defines a channel for each event type, such as `kogito-processinstances-events`, `kogito-usertaskinstances-events`, and `kogito-variables-events`. Therefore, when the process event add-on is enabled, you must add the event types to your `application.properties` file using the following properties:

.Properties to define event types in `application.properties` file
[source]
----
mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.topic=kogito-processinstances-events

mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-variables-events.topic=kogito-variables-events
mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-variables-events.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
----

Additionally, you can disable the publishing on any channel by setting the related property to false as shown in the following example:

=== {PRODUCT} source files add-on

The {PRODUCT} Source Files Add-on adds the capability of listing and downloading source files to {PRODUCT} projects.

> **⚠️**
This add-on isn't supposed to be used by end-users, if not needed for internal integrations, since it can be a potential security breach for some users' use cases.

To add the endpoints to download your services' source files, you can add the source files add-on as a dependency in your `pom.xml` file.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-source-files</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Access to all the endpoints is granted to the role `source-files-client`.
To define basic authentication, you can add the following code to your `application.properties` file:

.Example of credentials for the user `scott` and password `jb0ss`
[source,properties]
----

quarkus.security.users.embedded.plain-text=true
quarkus.security.users.embedded.users.scott=jb0ss
quarkus.security.users.embedded.roles.scott=source-files-client
----

You can also disable plain-text passwords by setting the `quarkus.security.users.embedded.plain-text` property to
`false` or just removing it from the configuration. In this case, the passwords are encrypted using MD5.

[id="proc-kogito-designing-app"]
== Designing the application logic for a {PRODUCT} service using DMN and BPMN

[role="_abstract"]
After you create your {PRODUCT} project, you can create or import Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 business processes, Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models, Drools Rule Language (DRL) business rules, XLS or XLSX decision tables, and other assets in the `src/main/resources` folder of your project. You can also include Java classes in the `src/main/java` folder of your project that act as Java services or provide implementations that you call from your business processes or decisions.

The example for this procedure is a basic {PRODUCT} service that provides a REST endpoint `/persons`. This endpoint is automatically generated based on an example `PersonProcess.bpmn2` business process that employs an example `PersonDecisions.dmn` DMN model to make decisions based on the data being processed.

The business process contains the business logic of the {PRODUCT} service. The process provides the complete set of steps to achieve the business goal. The process is also the entry point to the service that can be consumed by other services.

The business decision contains the decision logic of the {PRODUCT} service. In this example, the decision logic is invoked as part of the business process. You can define business rules and decisions in several ways, such as with DMN models, DRL rules, or XLS or XLSX decision tables. The example for this procedure uses a DMN model.

.Procedure
. In the Maven project that you generated for your {PRODUCT} service, navigate to the `src/main/java/org/acme` folder and add the following `Person.java` file:
+
--
.Example person Java object
[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import java.io.Serializable;

public class Person {

	private String name;
	private int age;
	private boolean adult;

	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public int getAge() {
		return age;
	}

	public void setAge(int age) {
		this.age = age;
	}

	public boolean isAdult() {
		return adult;
	}

	public void setAdult(boolean adult) {
		this.adult = adult;
	}

	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "Person [name=" + name + ", age=" + age + ", adult=" + adult + "]";
	}

}
----
This example Java object sets and retrieves a person's name, age, and adult status.
--
. Navigate to the `src/main/resources` folder and add the following `PersonDecisions.dmn` DMN decision model:
+
--
.Example `PersonDecisions` DMN decision requirements diagram (DRD)
image::kogito-dmn-example-person.png[Image of PersonDecisions decision diagram]

.Example DMN boxed expression for `isAdult` decision
image::kogito-dmn-example-person-logic.png[Image of PersonDecisions decision table]

.Example DMN data types
image::kogito-dmn-example-person-data-types.png[Image of PersonDecisions data types]

This example DMN model consists of a basic DMN input node and a decision node defined by a DMN decision table with a custom structured data type.

In VSCode (recommended), you can add the {VS_CODE_BUNDLE_LINK}[*{VS_CODE_BUNDLE}*] to design the decision requirements diagram (DRD), boxed expression, and data types with the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler.

To create this example DMN model quickly, you can copy the following `PersonDecisions.dmn` file content:

To create this example DMN model in VSCode using the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler, follow these steps:

.. Open the empty `PersonDecisions.dmn` file and in the upper-right corner of the DMN modeler, click the *Properties* icon and confirm that the DMN model *Name* is set to `PersonDecisions`.
.. In the left palette, select *DMN Input Data*, drag the node to the canvas, and double-click the node to name it `Person`.
.. In the left palette, select *DMN Decision*, drag the node to the canvas, double-click the node to name it `isAdult`, and link to it from the input node.
.. Select the decision node to display the node options and click the *Edit* icon to open the DMN boxed expression editor to define the decision logic for the node.
.. Click the undefined expression field and select *Decision Table*.
.. Click the upper-left corner of the decision table to set the hit policy to *Unique*.
.. Set the input and output columns so that the input source `Person.Age` with type `number` determines the age limit and the output target `isAdult` with type `boolean` determines adult status:
+

.. In the upper tab options, select the *Data Types* tab and add the following `tPerson` structured data type and nested data types:
+
.Example DMN data types

.. After you define the data types, select the *Editor* tab to return to the DMN modeler canvas.
.. Select the *Person* input node, click the *Properties* icon, and under *Information item*, set the *Data type* to `tPerson`.
.. Select the *isAdult* decision node, click the *Properties* icon, and under *Information item*, confirm that the *Data type* is still set to `boolean`. You previously set this data type when you created the decision table.
.. Save the DMN decision file.

. In the `src/main/resources` folder, add the following `PersonProcess.bpmn2` BPMN process model:
+
--
.Example `PersonProcess` BPMN process
image::kogito-bpmn-example-person.png[Image of person process diagram]

This example process consists of the following basic BPMN components:

* Start event
* Business rule task
* Exclusive gateway
* User task
* End events

In VSCode (recommended), you can add the {VS_CODE_BUNDLE_LINK}[*{VS_CODE_BUNDLE}*] to model the business process with the {PRODUCT} BPMN modeler.

To create this example process quickly, you can copy the following `PersonProcess.bpmn2` file content:

=== Using DRL rule units as an alternative decision service

[role="_abstract"]
As an alternative to using Decision Model and Notation (DMN) to define this example decision service, you can also use a Drools Rule Language (DRL) file implemented as a rule unit.

A DRL rule unit is a module for rules and a unit of execution. A rule unit collects a set of rules with the declaration of the type of facts that the rules act on. A rule unit also serves as a unique namespace for each group of rules. A single rule base can contain multiple rule units. You typically store all the rules for a unit in the same file as the unit declaration so that the unit is self-contained.

.Procedure
. In the `src/main/resources` folder of your example {PRODUCT} project, instead of using a DMN file, add the following `PersonRules.drl` file:
+
--
.Example `PersonRules` DRL file
[source]
----
package org.acme
unit PersonRules;

import org.acme.Person;

rule isAdult
	when
		$person: /person[ age > 18 ]
	then
    modify($person) {
    	setAdult(true)
    };
end
----

This example rule determines that any person who is older than 18 is classified as an adult. The rule file also declares that the rule belongs to the rule unit `PersonRules`. This is the rule unit that you define as part of the business rule task in the example BPMN process. When you build the project, the rule unit is generated and associated with the DRL file.

The rule also defines the condition using OOPath notation. OOPath is an object-oriented syntax extension to XPath for navigating through related elements while handling collections and filtering constraints.

You can also rewrite the same rule condition in a more explicit form using the traditional rule pattern syntax, as shown in the following example:

.Example `PersonRules` DRL file using traditional notation
[source]
----
package org.acme
unit PersonRules;

import org.acme.Person;

rule isAdult
	when
		$person: Person(age > 18) from person
	then
    modify($person) {
    	setAdult(true)
    };
end
----
--
. In the `src/main/resources` folder, use the {PRODUCT} BPMN modeler in VSCode to open the `PersonProcess.bpmn2` process diagram that you created.
. Select the `Evaluate person` business rule task and modify the following properties:

* *Implementation/Execution*: Set the following values:
** *Rule Language*: `DRL` (instead of `DMN`)
** *Rule Flow Group*: `unit:org.acme.PersonRules`
+
This rule unit syntax in the *Rule Flow Group* field specifies that you are using the `org.acme.PersonRules` rule unit instead of a traditional rule flow group. This is the rule unit that you referenced in the example DRL file. When you build the project, the business process implicitly declares the rule unit as part of the business rule task to execute the DRL file.
* *Data Assignments*: Open the assignment settings and change the data input *Name* to `person` (instead of `Person`). This accommodates the input variable syntax required by the DRL file.
. Select the connector that connects the exclusive gateway to the end event and for the *Implementation/Execution* property, verify that the *Condition Expression* is set to `Java` and change the condition to `return person.isAdult();`.
. Select the connector that connects the exclusive gateway to the user task and for the *Implementation/Execution* property, verify that the *Condition Expression* is set to `Java` and change the condition `return ! person.isAdult();`.
. Save the process file to update the model.

== Testing the decision logic for a {PRODUCT} service using test scenarios

[role="_abstract"]
As you develop business decisions in your {PRODUCT} services, you can use test scenarios to validate the functionality of your decisions before you begin running and using your {PRODUCT} services. With a test scenario, you use data from your project to set given conditions and expected results based on one or more defined business decisions. When you run the scenario, the expected results and actual results of the decision instance are compared. If the expected results match the actual results, the test is successful. If the expected results do not match the actual results, then the test fails.

You define test scenarios in `.scesim` (scenario simulation) files that you can model in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) using the {VS_CODE_BUNDLE_LINK}[*{VS_CODE_BUNDLE}*]. You can use one or multiple `.scesim` files in your {PRODUCT} project, and each `.scesim` file can contain one or multiple test scenarios based on the defined decision data.

The example for this procedure uses a basic `PersonDecisionsTest.scesim` test scenario file that validates the decision logic in the example `PersonDecisions.dmn` Decision Model and Notation (DMN) model that you created previously.

IMPORTANT: Test scenarios in {PRODUCT} currently support DMN decision services only. Test scenarios will support Drools Rule Language (DRL) decision services in a future release.

.Prerequisites
* You have created the `PersonDecisions.dmn` DMN model that determines whether a specified person is an adult or is underage.

.Procedure
. In the Maven project that contains your {PRODUCT} decision services, add the following dependency to the `pom.xml` file to enable test scenario execution for your project:
+
.Dependency to enable test scenario execution
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-scenario-simulation</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
. Navigate to the `src/main` folder of the project and create a `test` folder with the following subfolders. If you have an existing `test` folder structure, you can adapt the steps that follow according to your project layout.
+
.Test folder structure for test scenarios
[source]
----
src/main/test/
          └── java/testscenario
          └── resources
----
. Navigate to the `test/java/testscenario` folder and add the following `KogitoScenarioJunitActivatorTest.java` class:
+
--
.Activator class for test scenarios
[source,java]
----
package testscenario;

@org.junit.runner.RunWith(org.kogito.scenariosimulation.runner.KogitoJunitActivator.class)
public class KogitoScenarioJunitActivatorTest {

}
----

This activator class is a custom https://junit.org/junit5/[JUnit 5] runner that enables the execution of test scenario files in your {PRODUCT} project. When you run test scenarios, this class loads all `.scesim` files available in the project and executes them. For each row (scenario) in a test scenario file, the activator class generates a JUnit test result.
--
. Navigate to the `test/resources` folder and add the following `PersonDecisionsTest.scesim` test scenario file:
+
--
.Example test scenarios for `PersonDecisions` DMN decision logic
image::kogito-test-scenario-example-person.png[Image of PersonDecisionsTest test scenario]

The *GIVEN* columns specify input conditions based on the corresponding decision service. The *EXPECT* column specifies the expected results of the decision service based on the defined *GIVEN* conditions. Each row in the table is a defined scenario with example values for the *GIVEN* and *EXPECT* definitions to test the decision logic of the corresponding decision service.

This example test scenario file tests the decision logic for the following `PersonDecisions.dmn` model that you created previously. This DMN model determines whether a specified person is an adult or is underage.

.Example `PersonDecisions` DMN decision requirements diagram (DRD)
image::kogito-dmn-example-person.png[Image of PersonDecisions decision diagram]

.Example DMN boxed expression for `isAdult` decision
image::kogito-dmn-example-person-logic.png[Image of PersonDecisions decision table]

In VSCode (recommended), you can add the {VS_CODE_BUNDLE_LINK}[*{VS_CODE_BUNDLE}*] to design the test scenarios with the test scenario modeler.

To create these example test scenarios quickly, you can copy the following `PersonDecisionsTest.scesim` file content:

You can right-click the relevant header cells to insert or delete columns as needed to modify the table structure. You can also select the relevant header cells to modify or insert data objects from the *Test Tools* panel in the right toolbar.
.. For this example, modify the generated test scenario header cells and specified data objects as needed to create the following test scenario template. Use the *Test Tools* panel in the right toolbar to select and insert the data objects as needed. Many of the header cell values might already be defined for you.
+
* *GIVEN*: Verify that the first header cell (instance) is set to the *Person* data object and that the subheader cells (properties) are set to the *Age* and *Name* data objects. Delete any other columns under *GIVEN* that were automatically generated, if applicable.
* *EXPECT*: Verify that the first header cell (instance) is set to the *isAdult* data object and that the subheader cell (property) is set to the *value* data object. Delete any other columns under *EXPECT* that were automatically generated, if applicable.
+
.Define test scenario header cells
image::kogito-test-scenario-example-person-headers-create.png[Image of test scenario template]
.. In row 1, create a test scenario with the following values:
+
* *Scenario description*: `Is an adult`
* *GIVEN*: Set the following values:
** *Person* -> *Age*: `20`
** *Person* -> *Name*: `John Quark`
* *EXPECT*: Set the following value:
** *isAdult* -> *value*: `true`

+
This example scenario tests whether the person John Quark with 20 years of age is correctly identified by the `isAdult` DMN decision as an adult (`true`), based on the decision logic that adults are more than 18 years old.
.. Right-click any cell in row 1, select *Insert row below*, and in row 2, create another test scenario with the following values:
+
* *Scenario description*: `Is underage`
* *GIVEN*: Set the following values:
** *Person* -> *Age*: `15`
** *Person* -> *Name*: `Jenny Quark`
* *EXPECT*: Set the following value:
** *isAdult* -> *value*: `false`

+
This example scenario tests whether the person Jenny Quark with 15 years of age is correctly identified by the `isAdult` DMN decision as not an adult (`false`), based on the decision logic that adults are more than 18 years old.
.. Save the test scenario file.

The expected results defined in the `Is underage` test scenario did not match the actual results of the `isAdult` DMN decision instance in the `PersonDecisions.dmn` file. This mismatch of expected and actual results for the decision instance means that either the test scenario identified a flaw in the decision logic or the test scenario is incorrectly defined. In this case, the `Is underage` test scenario was intentionally modified incorrectly with an age of `20` instead of an age of `18` or less. Reverting the age to `15` as shown in the previous example resolves the error.

== Running a {PRODUCT} service

[role="_abstract"]
After you design the business decisions and processes for your {PRODUCT} service, you can run your Quarkus application in one of the following modes:

* *Development mode*: For local testing. On Quarkus, development mode also offers live reload of your processes and decisions in your running applications for advanced debugging.
* *JVM mode*: For compatibility with a Java virtual machine (JVM).
* *Native mode*: (Quarkus only, requires GraalVM or Mandrel) For direct binary execution as native code.

.Procedure
In a command terminal, navigate to the project that contains your {PRODUCT} service and enter one of the following commands, depending on your preferred run mode and application environment:

* For development mode:
+
--
.On Quarkus
[source]
----
$ mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
----
--
* For JVM mode:
+
--
.On Quarkus
[source]
----
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----
--

* For native mode (requires GraalVM):
+
--
.On Quarkus only
[source]
----
$ mvn clean package -Dnative
$ ./target/sample-kogito-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
----
--

[NOTE]
========

Alternatively, you can use a container builder image. You do not need to install GraalVM because a container containing GraalVM is pulled automatically. Note that the executable targets a Linux kernel by default. For example:

--
.On Quarkus only (GraalVM native build using container)
[source]
----
$ mvn clean package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build
----
--

To use Mandrel instead of GraalVM, run the following command:

--
.On Quarkus only (Mandrel native build using container)
[source]
----
$ mvn clean package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build -Dquarkus.native.builder-image=quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-mandrel:21.1-java11
----
--

========


For further information about building a native image, see https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#container-runtime[Quarkus - Building a Native Executable].

== Interacting with a running {PRODUCT} service

[role="_abstract"]
After your {PRODUCT} service is running, you can send REST API requests to interact with your application and execute your services according to how you set up the application.

This example tests the `/persons` REST API endpoint that is automatically generated based on the `PersonProcess.bpmn2` business process, according to the decisions in the `PersonDecisions.dmn` file (or the rules in the `PersonRules.drl` file if you used a DRL rule unit).

For this example, use a REST client, curl utility, or the Swagger UI configured for the application (such as \http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui or \http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) to send API requests with the following components:

* *URL*: `\http://localhost:8080/persons`
* *HTTP headers*: For `POST` requests only:
** `accept`: `application/json`
** `content-type`: `application/json`
* *HTTP methods*: `GET`, `POST`, or `DELETE`

[id="ref-kogito-glossary"]
== {PRODUCT} glossary of terms

[role="_abstract"]
This glossary defines terms, concepts, or components that are referenced frequently in {PRODUCT} documentation or that have a unique meaning or function in {PRODUCT}.

BPMN model::
A definition of a business process workflow based on the https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN[Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) specification]. BPMN is a standard established by the Object Management Group (OMG) for describing and modeling business processes. BPMN defines an XML schema that enables BPMN models to be shared between BPMN-compliant platforms and across organizations so that business analysts and business process developers can collaborate in designing and implementing BPMN process services. The BPMN standard is similar to and can be used together with the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard for designing and modeling business decisions.

business domain API::
An API that your business develops and implements within business applications that contain {PRODUCT} services.

business models::
The collection of BPMN process models, DMN decision models, DRL rules, XLS decision tables, and any other assets that define the business logic for a {PRODUCT} service.

CloudEvents format::
A specification for describing event data in a common way. {PRODUCT} runtime events for messages, processes, tasks, and other application activities are published in https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] format so that they can be consumed efficiently by other entities.

decision table::
A set of business rules defined in a tabular format. Each row in a decision table is a rule, and each column is a condition, an action, or another rule attribute.

development mode::
A project build option that provides a fast feedback loop from code changes to a running system using hot reload. Development mode also enables debugging tools such as Swagger in {PRODUCT} runtime services.

DRL rule::
A definition of a business rule in Drools Rule Language (DRL) format. DRL is a notation established by the https://www.drools.org/[Drools] open source business automation project for defining and describing business rules.

DRL rule unit::
A module for rules and a unit of execution. A rule unit collects a set of rules with the declaration of the type of facts that the rules act on. A rule unit also serves as a unique namespace for each group of rules. A single rule base can contain multiple rule units. You typically store all the rules for a unit in the same file as the unit declaration so that the unit is self-contained.

DMN model::
A definition of a business decision flow based on the https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation (DMN) specification]. DMN is a standard established by the Object Management Group (OMG) for describing and modeling operational decisions. DMN defines an XML schema that enables DMN models to be shared between DMN-compliant platforms and across organizations so that business analysts and business rules developers can collaborate in designing and implementing DMN decision services. The DMN standard is similar to and can be used together with the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard for designing and modeling business processes.

event listener::
A procedure or function in a program that reacts to a specified event, such as a completed node in a process or an executed decision.

intelligent application::
An optimized, integrated solution that uses {PRODUCT} services to implement business-domain knowledge.

////
{PRODUCT} Audit Investigation Console::
A user interface for monitoring and investigating Decision Model and Notation (DMN) model executions in {PRODUCT}.
////

////
{PRODUCT} CLI::
A command-line interface (CLI) that enables you to interact with the {PRODUCT} Operator for deployment tasks. The {PRODUCT} CLI also enables you to deploy {PRODUCT} services from source instead of relying on custom resources and YAML files.
////

////
//@comment: Excluding for now due to current build issues with the extension and we aren't using it at this point. (Stetson, 2 Apr 2020)
{PRODUCT} Quarkus extension::
An extension required to generate and build a Maven project for {PRODUCT} runtime services on the Quarkus Java framework. You can add the {PRODUCT} extension during project creation using the Quarkus Maven plugin or using the https://code.quarkus.io/[Code with Quarkus] extension manager.
////

////
{PRODUCT} Data Index Service::
A dedicated service in {PRODUCT} that stores all {PRODUCT} events related to processes, tasks, and domain data. The Data Index Service uses Apache Kafka messaging to consume CloudEvents messages from {PRODUCT} services, and then indexes the returned data for future GraphQL queries and stores the data in the Infinispan or MongoDB persistence store. The Data Index Service is at the core of all {PRODUCT} search, insight, and management capabilities.
////

{PRODUCT} domain-specific service::
A business automation service for your business domain that you create using {PRODUCT}. You define the logic of this service using BPMN process models, DMN decision models, or other business models, and any other supported runtime configurations. In {PRODUCT} documentation, the general term for _{PRODUCT} services_ that you create refers to this type of service.

////
{PRODUCT} Explainability Service::
A dedicated service in {PRODUCT} that provides an explanation for the decisions made in {PRODUCT} services, in conjunction with the _{PRODUCT} Trusty Service_.
////

////
{PRODUCT} Jobs Service::
A dedicated service in {PRODUCT} for scheduling BPMN process events that are configured to be executed at a specified time. These time-based events in a process model are known as _jobs_. The Jobs Service does not execute a job, but triggers a callback that might be an HTTP request on a given endpoint specified for the job request or any other configured callback. The Jobs Service receives requests for job scheduling and then sends a request at the time specified on the job request.

{PRODUCT} Management Console::
A user interface for viewing the state of all available {PRODUCT} services and managing process instances.

{PRODUCT} Operator::
An operator that deploys {PRODUCT} services and manages the required {PRODUCT} infrastructure services. The {PRODUCT} Operator is based on the https://sdk.operatorframework.io/[Operator SDK] and automates many of the deployment steps for you.
////

{PRODUCT} runtime event::
A record of a significant change of state in the application domain at a point in time. {PRODUCT} emits runtime events as a result of successfully executed requests, or _units of work_, in a process instance or task instance in a process. {PRODUCT} can use these events to notify third parties about changes to the BPMN process instance and its data.

////
{PRODUCT} runtime persistence::
An optional capability for preserving {PRODUCT} process data in your services across application restarts. {PRODUCT} persistence is based on https://infinispan.org/[Infinispan] and enables you to configure key-value storage definitions to persist data, such as active process nodes and process instance variables. Alternatively, https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] can be used.
////

////
{PRODUCT} supporting services::
The collection of middleware infrastructure services and other dedicated services that help you build additional functionality in the {PRODUCT} domain-specific services that you develop. Key middleware infrastructure services in {PRODUCT} include Infinispan, MongoDB, or Kafka Streams persistence, and Apache Kafka reactive messaging. Dedicated services provided by {PRODUCT} include the {PRODUCT} Data Index Service, Jobs Service, Trusty Service, and Explainability Service.
////

////
{PRODUCT} Task Console::
A user interface for viewing and interacting with user tasks in {PRODUCT} process services.

{PRODUCT} Trusty Service::
A dedicated service in {PRODUCT} for storing all {PRODUCT} tracing events related to decisions made in {PRODUCT} services. The _{PRODUCT} Explainability Service_ is typically used in conjunction with this service.
////

message event::
A specified point in a business process where a defined message is used as the input (received) or output (sent) as a result of the process execution. For example, a message event might be an email sent to a specified user after a task is complete.

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging::
A specification for sending and receiving messages within and between microservices using message brokers. {PRODUCT} supports https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging] for messaging in {PRODUCT} services, such as message events used as either input or output of business process execution.

middleware infrastructure services::
The collection of supplemental services in {PRODUCT} that provide capabilities such as persistence, messaging, and security. Key middleware infrastructure services in {PRODUCT} include Infinispan persistence and Apache Kafka reactive messaging.

process definition::
A model that defines the components, workflow, and functionality for a business process, such as a BPMN model.

process instance::
An occurrence of a pending, running, or completed business process, based on the process definition.

PROTO file (`.proto`)::
A data library used for marshalling Java objects in protobuf (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[protocol buffers]) format. {PRODUCT} runtime persistence and communication with Infinispan or MongoDB are handled through a protobuf schema and generated marshallers.

////
task lifecycle::
A mechanism that moves a user task or custom task (work item) across various phases, such as *Active* -> *Claim* -> *Complete*. {PRODUCT} provides standard lifecycle phases for user tasks and also supports custom lifecycles or lifecycle phases.
////

unit of work::
A component in {PRODUCT} that serves as the basis for {PRODUCT} runtime execution. Units of work capture all steps in a process and are used internally to move a process instance from one state to the next state. After all possible steps in a process are successfully executed, the final state is sent to the {PRODUCT} runtime as a runtime event. {PRODUCT} can then use these events to notify third parties about changes to the BPMN process instance and its data.

////
//@comment: Excluding for now due to current lack of support in Kogito. Will add once settled. (Stetson 2 Apr 2020)
Work item::
A custom task, typically a custom service task, that you can reuse across multiple business processes.

Work item handler::
A Java object that contains the implementation logic for a custom task (work item).
