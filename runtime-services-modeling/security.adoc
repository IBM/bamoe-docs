= Configuring Business Service security
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]


{PRODUCT_SHORT} is one of the applications that is designed for Quakus or SpringBoot application. Both frameworks natively offer a reliable authentication and authorization layer, to be used by user-designed applications if properly
configured. You will know how to configure your {PRODUCT_SHORT} project to use the Quarkus or SpringBoot authentication and authorization layer by defining some property values.

After configuring your {PRODUCT_SHORT} runtimes  correctly to integrate its framework security layer, it is possible to rely on an external Identity Providers (IdPs) like Keycloak or Microsoft Entra ID as your project’s Identity and Access Management Solution. A key role of this architecture is the Management Console, which provides your {PRODUCT_SHORT} application’s user an integrated environment to log in to your application and interact with its entities like process instances, submit task forms, and view jobs, in a secured and authenticated way. For more information on Management Console, see xref:../installation/management-console.adoc[Installing → {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE}].

== Quarkus (Authentication)

Quarkus supports the Bearer token authentication mechanism through the Quarkus OpenID Connect (OIDC) extension, based on the https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/[OpenID Connect] protocol. You will know how the authorization layer works in Quarkus with this useful https://quarkus.io/guides/security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication[tutorial] that explains how to do the set up correctly.

The first step is to configure the Quarkus OpenID Connect (OIDC) extension by setting the properties in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file. 

The list of properties required to setup your project may change based on your security needs, Identity and Access Management Solution. 

Following is an example of the configuration.

[source]
----
quarkus.oidc.enabled=true
quarkus.oidc.tenant-enabled=true
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8280/auth/realms/kogito
quarkus.oidc.client-id=kogito-service
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.application-type=hybrid
----

The following table describes in detail the properties suggested in the example, but it is only a subset of all properties available https://quarkus.io/guides/security-oidc-configuration-properties-reference[here].


[%header,cols=4]
[%autowidth]

|===

|Property | Description | Type | Default value
|quarkus.oidc.enabled | It determines OIDC extension is enabled
 | Boolean | true
|quarkus.oidc.tenant-enabled | Specifies whether the tenant configuration is
enabled
 | Boolean | true
|quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url  | The base URL of the OpenID
Connect (OIDC) server
 | URI | -
|quarkus.oidc.client.id  | The client id of the application
 | string  | -
|quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret  | The client secret used by the
client_secret_basic
authentication method
 | string  | -
|quarkus.oidc.application-type  | The application type, which can
be one of the following values:
web-app, service, hybrid.
To enable the compatibility
with Managment Console, this
property should be set as
“hybrid”
 | string  | service

== Quarkus (Authorization)

Quarkus incorporates a pluggable web security layer. When security is active, the system performs a
permission check on all HTTP requests to determine if they should proceed. For more information, see 
https://quarkus.io/guides/security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference[Authorization].

Following is an example of the configuration:

[source]
----
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.paths=/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.policy=authenticated
quarkus.http.auth.permission.public.paths=/q/*,/docs/*,/oidc/info
quarkus.http.auth.permission.public.policy=permit
----

Properties are pluggable based on how many permission rules you want to define for your application.

In the following example, two permissions are defined:

• authenticated: Used for REST entrypoints that requires an Authorization to be done.
• public: Used for publicly accessible REST entrypoints.

You can find a detailed explanation and  https://quarkus.io/version/3.8/guides/security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference[guide] to define your permissions and the effect on the required properties to add in your `application.property` file.

The available properties can be configured for all the used-defined permission rules.
For example, the `quarkus.http.auth.permission."permissions".policy` property with the specified permissions can have two properties detailed  in the following table:
  

[%header,cols=4]
[%autowidth]
|===

|Property | Description | Type | Default value
|quarkus.http.auth.permission."permissions".paths
(quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.paths
-
quarkus.http.auth.permission.public.paths)
 | The paths that this
permission check applies
to. If the path ends in /*
then this is treated as a
path prefix, otherwise it is
treated as an exact
match.
 | List of
URI
 | -
 |quarkus.http.auth.permission."permissions".policy
(quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.policy
-
quarkus.http.auth.permission.public.policy)
 | The HTTP policy that this
permission set is linked
to. There are three built-
in policies: permit, deny
and authenticated. Role
based policies can be
defined, and extensions
 | String | -

== Allowing {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} to connect to live Process services

For {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} to authenticate and connect to a Process service that is secured through an Identity Provider, the instance must make the Identity Provider URL available.

To solve this, you need to use the `quarkus-oidc-proxy` extension, as it creates new endpoints in the Process service where one of them is `/q/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration`, which provides the Identity Provider URL (the same URL that is defined in the `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` property).

To add the `quarkus-oidc-proxy` extension, you need to add the following code to the list of dependencies in the `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- OIDC Proxy -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkiverse.oidc-proxy</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-oidc-proxy</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.3</version>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: Version 0.1.3 of `quarkus-oidc-proxy` is compatible with Quarkus 3.15. Do not use versions 0.2.x.
