== Running the {PRODUCT} workflow example applications

[role="_abstract"]
To get started quickly with {PRODUCT}, you can run any of the example applications in the bamoe-{VERSION}-kogito-examples.zip archive and experiment with the {PRODUCT} services.

For this procedure, use the `process-usertasks-timer-data-index-persistence-addon-quarkus` application. You can follow similar steps with the other {PRODUCT} examples on Quarkus.
