{MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} is a web application for viewing the state of all available _Business Services_ and managing and interacting with process instances:

.{MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE}
image::runtime-services-modeling/mgmt-console-process-instances.png[Image of {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE}]

You can use {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} to manage and interact with process instances, complete User Tasks and manage Jobs.

In order to be compatible with {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} your _Business Services_ must use the following {PRODUCT_SHORT} components:

* *{PRODUCT_SHORT} Data-Index service*: Enables the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} to access stored events related to processes and domain data from your _Business Services_. The Data-Index service requires PostgreSQL persistence.
* *{PRODUCT_SHORT} Process management add-on*: Enables the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} to interact with the Process data from your _Business Services_ through the add-on REST endpoint `/management/processes`.
If you do not enable this add-on for your {PRODUCT_SHORT} service, the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} provides read-only access to your service data without the ability to modify instances, such as aborting Process instances.

To visualize the process instance execution path at the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE}, add the following add-on:

* *{PRODUCT_SHORT} Process SVG add-on*: Enables the Process SVG diagram to visualize the process instance execution path.
If this add-on is not enabled for your {PRODUCT_SHORT} service, the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} does not display the diagram panel.

---

== Running the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE}

You can run the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} container image locally or add it to your {PRODUCT_SHORT} infrastructure on OpenShift.

.Local Docker container
. In a terminal, enter the following command to run the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} locally:
+
.Running the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE}
[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
docker run -p 8280:8080 quay.io/bamoe/management-console:{IMAGE_VERSION}
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The default port for the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} is 8080, but this example specifies port 8280 to avoid conflicts with the example {PRODUCT_SHORT} service running at port 8080.
====

For installing to OpenShift or any other Kubernetes cluster, refer to xref:../installation/management-console.adoc[Installing → {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE}]

== Using the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} features

{MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} consists of the following tabs that allow you to interact with your process instances and data:

* *Process Instances*: List process and subprocess instances and filter them by status or business key;

* *Jobs*: List available jobs, filter them by status, and perform actions for any individual one, such as view details, reschedule, or cancel.

* *Tasks*: List User Tasks from Processes, filter them by status or name, and submit forms to fulfill tasks.

But before you can use these tabs, you need to connect your {PRODUCT_SHORT} service to the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE}.

=== Connecting to a {PRODUCT_SHORT} service instance

image::runtime-services-modeling/mgmt-console-home-no-connections.png[Image of {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} home page without connections]

To do so, click on the **+ Connect to a runtime…** button and fill in the required information on the
modal:

- **Alias**: The name to give your connected {PRODUCT_SHORT} service instance (can be anything that helps you identify it).
- **URL**: The {PRODUCT_SHORT} service root URL (E.g., http://localhost:8080).
- **Force login prompt (for secured runtimes only)**: Check this if you are already logged in your Identity Provider but would like to log in again (maybe with a different user).

More settings are available in the **Advanced OpenID Connect settings** section:

- **Client ID**: Overrides the Client ID used for this connection. Defaults to the value of the `RUNTIME_TOOLS_MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE_OIDC_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.
- **Scope**: Overrides the scopes requested to the Identity Provider. Useful from some Identity Providers that, for example, will only grant a Refresh Token if the `offline_access` scope is included in the token request. Defaults to `openid email profile`.
- **Audience**: This is the `audience` parameter in the Authorization request. Used to identify the service that the token is intended for. Empty by default.

image::runtime-services-modeling/mgmt-console-home-add-connection-modal-filled.png[Image of {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} new connection modal]

If your {PRODUCT_SHORT} service uses OpenID Connect authentication, you should be redirected to the Identity Provider
(IdP) login page or, if you’re already logged in, redirected back to the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE}. If your
{PRODUCT_SHORT} service is unsecured, it should connect directly.

Once logged in, the management pages will be displayed in the side menu, listing Process Instances,
Jobs, and Tasks.

Clicking on the **View Details** button opens a side panel with more details regarding the current task, including the parent process, possible assigned users/groups, id, name, and state.

The form is autogenerated based on the User Task defined in the parent process definition and filling and submitting it will progress the task to the next phase of the task lifecycle.

==== Impersonation

User Tasks can be assigned to a specific user or user group, and submitting them is limited to that assigned user. But when using a unsecured {PRODUCT_SHORT} service or authenticated as a user with impersonation powers, you can submit the task as the assigned user by impersonating them.

image::runtime-services-modeling/mgmt-console-task-impersonation.png[Image of the Impersonation form]

Fill the **User** and/or **Group** fields in the Impersonation form and click ** Apply** to start impersonating a specific user or user group.

To stop impersonation, click the **Reset** button.

[NOTE]
When viewing User Tasks from a secured {PRODUCT_SHORT} service with a user without impersonation powers, only tasks assigned to the current user or user group can be submitted.
