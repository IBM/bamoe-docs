{MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} is a web application for viewing the state of all available {PRODUCT_SHORT} services and manage and interact with process instances:

.{MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE}
image::runtime-services-modeling/kogito-management-console.png[Image of {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE}]

You can use {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} to manage and interact with process instances, manage User Tasks and Jobs. These are the different elements you can view:

* processes

* subprocess

* details of node instances

* abort process instances

* domain-specific process data


In order to be visible in {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} your {PRODUCT_SHORT} services must use the following {PRODUCT_SHORT} components:

* *{PRODUCT_SHORT} Data-Index service*: Enables the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} to access stored events related to processes and domain data from your {PRODUCT_SHORT} services. The Data-Index service requires PostgreSQL persistence.
* *{PRODUCT_SHORT} Process management add-on*: Enables the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} to interact with the process data from your {PRODUCT_SHORT} services through the add-on REST endpoint `/management/processes`.
If you do not enable this add-on for your {PRODUCT_SHORT} service, the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} provides read-only access to your service data without the ability to modify instances, such as aborting process instances.
//For more information about the process management add-on, see xref:../workflow/configuring-persistence-for-stateful-workflows.html[].

To visualize the process instance execution path at the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE}, add the following add-on:

* *{PRODUCT_SHORT} process SVG add-on*: Enables the process SVG diagram to visualize the process instance execution path.
If this add-on is not enabled for your {PRODUCT_SHORT} service, the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} does not display the diagram panel.
//For more information about the process SVG add-on, see xref:con-bpmn-process-svg-addon_kogito-developing-process-services[].



== Using the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} to manage process instances

You can use the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} to view and manage process instance details from your {PRODUCT_SHORT} services.
You can run the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} for local {PRODUCT_SHORT} services or add it to your {PRODUCT_SHORT} infrastructure on OpenShift.

.Prerequisites
* A {PRODUCT_SHORT} Data-Index Service instance is configured and running for your {PRODUCT_SHORT} service.
The Data-Index Service enables the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} to access stored process data.
The Data-Index Service requires Infinispan or MongoDB persistence and Apache Kafka messaging for your {PRODUCT_SHORT} service.
//For information about the Data-Index Service, see {URL_CONFIGURING_KOGITO}#con-data-index-service_kogito-configuring[_{CONFIGURING_KOGITO}_].
* The `pom.xml` file of your {PRODUCT_SHORT} project contains the following dependency for the process management add-on.
This add-on enables the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} to interact with the process data through the add-on REST endpoint `/management/processes`.
//For more information about the process management add-on, see xref:con-bpmn-process-management-addon_kogito-developing-process-services[].

=== Enabling {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} security

For security, the {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} relies on https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] solution for authentication.
Once a user is authenticated, {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} uses bearer tokens to communicate with other {PRODUCT_SHORT} services.

IMPORTANT: By default, To enable security it is required to run {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} in "PROD" mode.

.Prerequisites
* You have a https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] server running.

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you log in to the Keycloak administration console, navigate to the respective client configuration, and add correct URLs of different applications.
For easier configuration, you can add ***  in the *Web Origins*, however, it can cause security issues.
You can also add the origin URLs as a parameter to the *Web Origins*, which can prevent the issues related to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.

If your {PRODUCT_SHORT} project has a custom task lifecycle that defines custom states, you can use the following environment
variables to configure the Task Console to use those states and show them in the filters:

* `RUNTIME_TOOLS_TASK_CONSOLE_KOGITO_TASK_STATES_LIST`: Comma-separated list of values containing all the states that you want to show in the Task Console.
Without this property, the Task Console shows the default lifecycle states `Ready`, `Reserved`, `Completed`, `Aborted`, and `Skipped`.
* `RUNTIME_TOOLS_TASK_CONSOLE_KOGITO_TASK_ACTIVE_STATES_LIST`: Comma-separated list of values containing the active task states.
These states are used in the *Task Inbox* default filter. Without this property, the default active states are `Ready` and `Reserved`.
