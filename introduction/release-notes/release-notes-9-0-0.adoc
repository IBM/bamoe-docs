== Unsupported capabilities on 9.0

Note that only decisions are supported in BAMOE version 9.0. Stateful process use cases are not yet supported although BPMN files can be used for straight through processing focused on orchestrating rules. This means that stateful processes may not function as expected in your current 9.0 environment if you have implementations based on the open source community versions.
