include::../../partials/attributes.adoc[]

{PRODUCT_LONG}, version {VERSION_910} introduces significant enhancements and capabilities as well as providing critical security and known issue fixes.

This release supports the following features:

=== Modernized Technology Stack

* Java upgrade - Incorporates an upgraded technology stack featuring Java 17 and Jakarta EE 10.

* Quarkus LTS upgrade - Supports the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Quarkus 3.8.4 by enhancing performance and reliability.


=== Transition to downstream build

* Independent build - In this release, BAMOE employs a complete downstream build by eliminating any dependency on open-source binaries.

* Maven Repository Distribution:

** With the transition of the KIE projets to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), it has become necessary to rename a number of Maven modules. For more information, see xref:../../upgrading/upgrading.adoc[Upgrading]

** The downstream libraries are no longer available on Maven Central. Instead, they are provided in a zip file for integration into corporate Maven Repository Managers such as Nexus or Artifactory. {PRODUCT_SHORT} includes a production-ready Maven repository as a container for customers without a corporate Maven Repository Manager. You can configure the details for local Maven settings using the information in the document. xref:../../installation/configure-maven.adoc[Learn more...]
 
=== Helm Chart
    
A new Helm Chart is available and can be used to deploy {CANVAS} image on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster using the Helm package manager. This Helm chart, facilitates the management (define, install, and upgrade) of complex Kubernetes applications. xref:../../installation/kie-helm-charts.adoc[Learn more...]

=== Technology preview: Stateful process services 

Stateful process services are available in this release as a technology preview. This functionality is supported by a new compact architecture which minimizes the inter-component communication and ensures stability and the robustness of your applications. While BPMN models were supported in previous versions, additional BPMN functionality is available to support stateful processes. You can design your BPMN processes with Canvas or the BPMN modeler in VSCode. xref:../../workflow/workflow-techpreview.adoc[Learn more...]

=== New DMN Editor

A New DMN editor in this release provides runtime and design support for DMN 1.5 models at conformance level 3. You can design your DMN models with BAMOE Canvas or import existing DMN models into your {PRODUCT_SHORT} projects for deployment and execution. The 9.0.x DMN editor, referred as the Classic DMN editor, is still available. By default, the New DMN Editor will be opened when you open it. To switch to the Classic DMN Editor, click the "New DMN Editor" dropdown and select "Switch back to the Classic DMN Editor". 

Existing DMN files can be opened directly in the new DMN Editor; however, if they are edited and saved, they will no longer be compatible with the classic DMN editor. xref:../../editing/authoring-decisions.adoc[Learn more...]
