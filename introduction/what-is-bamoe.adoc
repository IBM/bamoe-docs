IBM {PRODUCT_SHORT} is a cloud-native business automation technology designed for building cloud-ready business applications.
It is based on the upstream Apache KIE open-source community, which includes popular technologies such as Drools, jBPM, and Kogito.
You can explore the Apache KIE community at https://kie.apache.org[kie.apache.org].

IBM {PRODUCT_SHORT} is not a one-size-fits-all solution.
It is optimized for hybrid cloud environments and can easily adapt to specific domain and tooling needs.
Its core objective is to empower you to transform a set of business processes and decisions into your own domain-specific, cloud-native services.
With {PRODUCT_SHORT}, you build a cloud-native application by creating a set of independent, domain-specific services designed to deliver business value.
The processes and decisions you use to describe the desired behavior are executed as part of the services you create.
The resulting services are highly scalable, and the runtime is optimized for your service's needs.

== Cloud-native Approach
IBM {PRODUCT_SHORT} is designed to run and scale on cloud infrastructure, leveraging the latest cloud-based technologies to enhance performance and scalability.
By integrating with technologies like Quarkus and Apache Kafka, {PRODUCT_SHORT} ensures quick start times and instant scaling on container application platforms like OpenShift.

=== Some Compatible Technologies:
OpenShift:: Based on Kubernetes, OpenShift is the target platform for building and managing containerized applications with {PRODUCT_SHORT}.
Quarkus: A native Java stack for Kubernetes, Quarkus allows you to build applications efficiently using IBM {PRODUCT_SHORT} services.

GraalVM:: Used with Quarkus, GraalVM enables native compilation with IBM {PRODUCT_SHORT}, resulting in fast start-up times and a minimal footprint.
For example, a native {PRODUCT_SHORT} service can start in approximately 0.003 milliseconds, about 100 times faster than a non-native start-up.
This speed is crucial in a cloud ecosystem, especially for small serverless applications.
Prometheus and Grafana: These tools are compatible with {PRODUCT_SHORT} services for monitoring and analytics, with optional extensions available for enhanced functionality.

Kafka:: A middleware technology supported by {PRODUCT_SHORT} for messaging and security, ensuring robust communication and data integrity within your applications.


=== Domain-specific Flexibility
IBM {PRODUCT_SHORT} adapts to your business domain, eliminating the need to modify your domain to work with {PRODUCT_SHORT}.
You can expose your {PRODUCT_SHORT} services through domain-specific APIs based on the processes and decisions you have defined.
These domain-specific APIs for {PRODUCT_SHORT} services do not require third-party or internal APIs.
For example, a process for onboarding employees could generate remote REST API endpoints that allow you to onboard new employees or retrieve information about their status using domain-specific JSON data.
You can also expose domain-specific data through events so that the data can be consumed and queried by other services.

=== Developer-centered Experience
IBM {PRODUCT_SHORT} is designed to provide an optimal developer experience.
You can utilize much or all of your existing tooling and workflow to develop, build, and deploy {PRODUCT_SHORT} services, whether locally for testing or in the cloud.
Quarkus offers development-mode features to assist with local testing, such as live reloading of your processes and decisions in your running applications for advanced debugging.
{PRODUCT_SHORT} tooling is embeddable, allowing you to continue using the workflow you are already familiar with for cloud-native services. For
example, the IBM {PRODUCT_SHORT} Developer Tools for VS Code enable you to edit your Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) business processes and Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models directly in your VS Code IDE alongside your regular application code.
