= IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions :: Documentation

Documentation for the IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions product lives here.
It is a combination of Asciidoc files and possibly links to other repositories within the Apache KIE community.

== Installing asciidoctor

Please consult the https://asciidoctor.org/#installation[asciidoctor installation instructions].

== Building

Using either the native asciidoctor, asciidoctor.js, or asciidoctor in Docker, execute the following command to build the documentation from the cloned repository:

[source,shell]
----
asciidoctor -vw -R . -D output \**/*.adoc
----

This will build all the files as HTML, show you any warnings, and output into the `output` directory, which is ignored by git.

== Authoring

We recommend using the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-vscode[VS Code extension] for authoring and previewing.

== Writing Conventions

* One sentence per line.
* Tables one column per line, rows seperated by an empty line.
* TBD

== Repository Layout

The root of the repository contains a `nav.adoc` file, which closely resembles an https://antora.org[Antora] navigation file.
This is used in building the Table of Contents (TOC) for the documentation.

Each main section in the navigation file corresponds to a directory.
Each secondary section of the navigation has its own file.

Images are kept at the root level.

All attributes are in the `partials/attributes.adoc` file and included at the top of every file.
