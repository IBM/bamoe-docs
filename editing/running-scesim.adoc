Running the unit test with Test scenarios enable you to validate the functionality of business decisions and business decision data during project development. Test Scenario models can be created and modified with VS Code Extension. 

== Setup and creation of Test Scenarios

Refer to xref:../editing/authoring-scesim.html[Authoring unit tests with Test Scenarios] for setup and scenario creation.

== Executing the Test Scenario
1. **Save the File**:
   Save the `.scesim` file (`CTRL+S`).
2. **Run Tests**:
   Open a terminal in your project's root directory (eg. the `incubator-kie-kogito-examples/kogito-quarkus-examples/dmn-pmml-quarkus-example`) and execute:
+
[source,console]
----
   $ mvn clean test
----
+

Alternatively, if you installed the `Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat` extension, run the test from `KogitoScenarioJunitActivator.java` using the `Run Java` button in VS Code.
3. **Verify Results**:
   Check the results to ensure the scenarios pass. The test results will be visible in your Terminal after the completion of the `mvn clean test` command.
