= Authoring decisions
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

Decision authoring on {CANVAS} happens inside the Editor page for Decisions, where you can edit, validate, run, and deploy DMN files.

This version contains a new DMN editor that is compatible with DMN 1.5.
The new editor as the New DMN Editor, and the older editor as the Classic DMN Editor.
It's important to note that it is still possible to use the Classic DMN Editor but bear in mind that files edited on the New DMN Editor will not be compatible with the Classic DMN Editor, even though the opposite is possible.

By default, the New DMN Editor will be opened, and the user can choose to switch to the Classic DMN Editor by clicking into the "New DMN Editor" dropdown and selecting "Switch back to the classic DMN Editor".
This operation will save the user preference to keep using the Classic DMN Editor for future work.

.Switch to Classic DMN Editor

== New DMN Editor

This section will cover the New DMN Editor.
The Overview lists the additional capabilities, followed by a more detailed description of its features and how to use them.

=== Overview

The New DMN Editor can open and edit DMN files from version 1.5 or below, but it will always save as a DMN 1.5.
This is important as it will not be possible to open the file generated by it on other editors that don't support version 1.5, like the Classic DMN Editor.

The Classic DMN Editor supports DMN version 1.2 with some additional 1.3 capabilities, making this a huge step in functionalities.
The following sections contain a summary of the different DMN versions starting with version 1.3.

=== version 1.3

The Classic DMN Editor already supported some 1.3 features, such as the temporal FEEL Functions.
A new addition is the Group node, a different type of artifact.
It enables the user to create groups on the Decision Requirements Diagram (DRD), enhancing the experience by providing a better way to organize and visualize the model.

.Group node
image::tools/authoringDecisions/overview-1.3-group-node.png[width=300]

=== version 1.4

This version adds new functionalities for the FEEL functions, Boxed Expression, and DRD representation.

FEEL Functions::
The following FEEL functions were added: `context`, `context put`, `context merge`, `number floor`, `number ceiling`, `number round up`, `number round down`, `number round half up`, `number round half down` and `string join`.

Boxed Expression::
Adds the Filter, Conditional, Iterator, Every and Some Boxed Expressions.
+
NOTE: Still a working in progress

DRD::
Adds a marker on nodes that have a collection data type.

.Collection mark
image::tools/authoringDecisions/overview-1.4-collection-marker.png[width=300]

=== version 1.5

This version adds new FEEL Functions, changes to the DRD and some general changes.

FEEL Functions::
Adds the `list replace` function, and the scientific notation for numbers.

DRD::
Adds the representation of an alternative Input Data node which has a visual cohesion to the BPMN model.
This alternative visual representation is a DRD option, affecting all Input Data nodes on the DRD.
More about this in the DRD section.

.alternative Input Data node representation
image::tools/authoringDecisions/overview-1.5-alternative-input-data-node.png[width=150]

General::
[id="import-to-default-namespace"]
Import to default namespace:::
+
Adds the possibility to import a new DMN into the default namespace.
This removes the necessity to give a name to the external model, enabling it to compose a complex model with multiple small models.

Previous missing functionalities::
One of the missing functionalities on the Classic DMN Editor is the visual representation of nodes that have missing dependencies on the current DRD.

You can have multiple DRDs and not necessarily import all nodes.
This visual representation helps to show the missing requirements in the current DRD.

'''

=== The Editor

Here you can see all the functionalities of the New DMN Editor.

.New DMN Editor overview
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-overview.png[720]

The diagram and Boxed Expression Editor can be accessed on A.
The data types editor can be accessed on B and to manage the included models we have C.

=== A. Diagram

Opening the diagram for the first time, there are a few components with which to become familiar.

.New DMN Editor diagram overview
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-overview.png[720]

. The editor empty state.
+
The New DMN Editor empty state gives the possibility to easily bootstrap a new model with two options.
Creating a Decision node with a Decision Table or a Decision with an Input Data node.
+
. The node Palette:
.. Decision Requirements Graph (DRG) nodes.
.. Artifact nodes.
.. All DRG nodes.
.. External nodes.
+
. The DRD dropdown.
+
It gives the ability to change the current opened DRD, rename it, or change its properties.
+
. The properties panel of the selected element.
. The overlay panel, with customizable style and visualization properties.
. The auto layout button, to help you organize your DRD.
. The canvas properties, where you can control the zoom or what you are visualizing.

More about these functionalities are explained later.

==== 1. Empty state

The empty state enables the user to easily bootstrap a new DMN.
It has two options:

. New Decision Table
+
Creates a new Decision node with an empty Decision Table.
+
.Decision node with a Decision Table
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-empty-state-decision-node.png[width=300px]

+
. New Decision with Input Data
+
Creates a new Input Data and Decision node with an Information Requirement relationship.
+
.Input Data and Decision nodes
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-empty-state-input-decision.png[width=300px]

==== 2. Palette

The Palette enables the user to interact with the DRD and DRG.
It's possible to:

* Add a new node to the DRD.
* Use nodes from other DRDs.
* Add nodes from external models.
* Create artifact nodes to the DRD, improving documentation, organization, and visualization.

.a. Add DRG node

To add a new DRG node the user needs to drag the desired node from the palette and drop it into the diagram.

.Dragging a new Input Data node from the Palette
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-drag-from-palette.gif[width=300px]

.b. Artifact nodes

The artifact nodes give the user the tools to improve the documentation and visualization of the DRG by modifying the DRD.
The Group node creates a visual separation, and the Text Annotation enables to writing a small documentation.

.c. All DRG nodes

Clicking on it will open a modal providing access to the list of all DRG nodes that are part of the current file.
It's possible to filter the nodes by name, and nodes that are part of the current DRD are grayish.
Clicking and dragging the node name to the diagram will add the node to the current DRD.
More about this can be found in the DRD section.

.Dragging a Decision node from DRG nodes
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-palette-all-drg-nodes.gif[width=300px]

.d. External nodes

All nodes that are part of the included models can be found here.

NOTE: See the <<included-models, Included models>> section to learn more about **Included models**.

Clicking on it will open a modal showing all nodes separated by namespace, where you can filter the nodes by name.

.Dragging an external Input Data node
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-palette-external-nodes.gif[width=300px]

Additionally, it's possible to see the chosen name for the included model and the DMN file name from where it comes from.
In the above example the name is “ex” and the filename “Another DMN.dmn”.

==== Nodes

In this section we explore all node features, for this, we will be using a Decision node.

.Decision node components
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-node-overview.png[width=300px]

. Node name
+
The node name has a uniqueness validation.
The editor doesn't allow you to rename a node to a name that is already being used by another node. Empty names are also invalid.
Trying to rename a node to an invalid one will cause it to roll back to its previous name.
The only moment you can have nodes with the same name is when you create two or more nodes of the same type without renaming them.
The following example illustrates two Decision nodes that were created without renaming and an Input Data node where we try to rename it to “New Decision”, and after it to an empty name.
+
.Node unique name
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-node-unique-name.gif[width=300px]
+
. Node type
+
Nodes that have a data type, show this information on top of the node.
It's possible to change the node data type using the dropdown menu, or even access a custom data type to have a better visualization of the type.
More about the Data Types are covered in the B section.
+
.Editing node data type
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-node-data-type.gif[width=300px]
+
. New relationship
+
It's possible to create a new requirement or association relationship from the target node to another node respecting the DMN specification.
The available options vary from node to node.
+
.Create new relationship
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-node-new-relationship.gif[width=300px]
+
. New connected node
+
It's possible to create a new connected node from the target node.
It will create a node with the respective relationship.
The available options vary based on the node type and respect the DMN specification.
+
.Create new connected node
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-node-new-connected.gif[width=300px]
+
. Edit
+
The Edit button is only available for the Decisions and Business Knowledge Model (BKM) nodes.
Clicking on it opens the DMN Boxed Expression Editor with the node expression.
The Boxed Expression Editor has access to the DRG context, and is powered by an auto-completion tool, enhancing the user experience when building their expressions.
+
.Open node Boxed Expression Editor
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-node-boxed-expression-editor.gif[width=500px]
+
. Properties panel
+
Clicking on this button will open the Properties Panel of the node.
On this panel, it's possible to check and edit the node name, type, description, allowed answer, documentation links, font styles, and shape styles.
Also, it's possible to check the node ID.
More about this can be read in the "Properties Panel” section.
+
.Open node properties panel
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-node-properties-panel.gif[width=500px]
+
. Resize handler
+
Clicking on the small arrow and dragging around it's possible to resize the target node.
Each node has a minimal width and height, trying to resize it to a smaller size will not affect the node.
+
.Resize node
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-node-resize.gif[width=500px]

===== Decision Service
The **Decision Service** node, similar to the BKM node, is useful for reusing logic.
However, it also allows for the wrapping and structuring of a larger set of Decision nodes while producing a single output.

.Decision Service Node
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-decision-service-node.png[]

**(1) Output decisions**
These decisions (**Decision A** and **Decision B**) results will be present in the **Decision Service** output. 
The number of nodes in this section (and their Data Types) determines whether the **Decision Service** will be a Simple or Complex Data Type.
In case of multiple items in the **Output decisions** section we are sure the **Decision Service** output is a Complex type.
In case of a single item in the **Output decisions** section the **Decision Service** output depends on the type of the item.

**(2) Encapsulated decisions**
These decisions (**Decision C**) results will be not present in the **Decision Service** output.
They will be used only for its computation. 

**(3) Input decisions**
These decisions (**Decision D**) are parameters for the **Decision Service** execution.
You need to provide their values during **Decision Service** invocation.

**(4) Input data**
These inputs (**Input Data One**, **Input Data Two** and **Input Data Three**) are parameters for the **Decision Service** execution.
You need to provide their values during **Decision Service** invocation. 

**(5) Invoking this Decision Service in FEEL**
Is an example of the **Decision Service** invocation expression with its parameters in correct order.
To change the parameters order, you can drag and drop items from the **Input decisions** and **Input data** sections.

In the **Decision Service** node, there is a divider line in the middle.
The divider can be dragged to make **output** or **encapsulated** sections size appropriate for your needs.

The **Decision Service** node needs to be selected in order to see its context menus.
It is not enough to hover over the **Decision Service** node, as it is for other DMN node types.


===== Unknown node

Is a node with an invalid DMN element reference(`dmnElementRef`).
We cannot render such a node properly as the reference couldn't be found on the current model.
For such nodes, users will see a placeholder node.

.Unknown node example
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-unknown-node.png[]

(1) Reference is the `dmnElementRef` value that could not resolve to a node.
The editor does not provide a feature to change this value.
To change this value, open and edit the file manually outside the editor.
The `dmnElementRef` has a `QName` value, with the `namespaceDeclarationName:nodeId` format.
For elements that are referenced on the current namespace, `namespaceDeclarationName` isn't present, meaning the `dmnElementRef` will have the `nodeId` format.

- The `namespaceDeclarationName` part should be equal to the declaration name of the included model namespace, which must be included on the <<included-models, Included models>> tab.
- The `nodeId` should then refer to one of the nodes from the included model.

==== 3. DRD

The new editor gives us a brand new experience related to the DRDs.
In the image below we can have an overview of this functionality.

.DRD Overview
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-drd-overview.png[width=500px]

Clicking on 1 will open the DRD dropdown.
To edit the DRD name, you can click on its name and type the new desired name.
On 2, you can create new DRDs, which will automatically change to a new empty DRD.
The 3 is the list of DRDs on the DRG.
Finally, 4 is the DRD options of the selected DRD.

.DRG nodes overview
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-drg-nodes-overview.png[width=500px]

In the example above, the user has created a new DRD and has it renamed to DRD2, which we can see on 1.
Clicking on 2 will open the DRG nodes (*3*).
In this example, the “My Decision” and “Person” nodes are present on the DRG but not in the current DRD.
By clicking on it and dragging it into the diagram the node will be added to the current DRD.
This behavior is illustrated below.

.Dragging a new node from the DRG nodes list
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-drg-nodes-dragging.gif[width=500px]

It's possible to see that the “My Decision” became grayish on the DRG nodes modal, as it's now present on the current DRD.
Also, it has a “three dot” mark on the bottom of it, which tells us, that this node has dependencies that are not shown on the current DRD.
By dragging the “Person” node we can see the three dots disappearing, and an information requirement is automatically placed.

.DRD alteranative representation for the Input Data node
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-drd-overview-alternative-input.png[width=500px]

Also, it's possible to change the classic shape to an alternative one, making it more visually cohesive with the BPMN model.
This change affects the entire DRD, so it's not possible to have just one node with an alternative shape.

==== 4. Properties panel

The properties panel lets you manage the properties of a Decision element.
Enabling the possibility to add detailed descriptions, and documentation links and tweak the font and shape styles.

==== 5. Overlay properties

On the Overlay properties, it's possible to tweak user preferences, which helps with visualization and organization.

. Snapping -> Makes the elements snap into an invisible grid.
It's possible to tweak the grid layout by changing the "Horizontal" and "Vertical" values.
+
.Enable/disable snapping
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-overlay-snapping.gif[]
+
. Highlight selected node(s) hierarchy -> This option is very useful for complex models where the user needs to verify which nodes are somehow impacting the selected node.
+
.Enable/disable node hierarchy
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-overlay-hierarchy.gif[]

. Show data type toolbar on nodes -> Control if the data type toolbar is visible or not on the Input Data, Decision, BKM, and Decision Service nodes.
+
.Enable/disable data type toolbar on nodes
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-overlay-show-data-type.gif[]

. Enable styles -> It's possible to turn on/off the node styles.
It's important to notice that this option will not change the file, only the visual representation.
+
.Enable/disable data type toolbar on nodes
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-overlay-style.gif[]

==== 6. Autolayout (beta)

The Autolayout is still a beta feature.
It will automatically organize your model by arranging related nodes closer to each other.

.Enable/disable data type toolbar on nodes
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-autolayout.gif[]

==== 7. Visualization controls

The visualization controls give the user the option to zoom in/out from the model, to make the viewport fit the current model, or to lock any interaction.

=== B. Data types

The data types tab is where all custom data types of the DMN model are placed.
The New DMN Editor brings a brand new experience for managing custom data types.
The following two images show a model without custom data types and the next are the data types of the DMN sample.

.Empty data types tab
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-data-types-empty.png[]

.Sample data types tab
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-data-types-sample.png[]

[id="adding-a-data-type"]
==== Adding a data type

On the empty data types tab the New DMN Editor gives us the possibility to create data types in two ways.
To create a custom data type from scratch, use the "Create a custom data type" (*1*) option.
To paste a custom data type, you need to have one saved on your clipboard, and then click into the "Paste data type" (*2*).

.Empty data types tab overview
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-data-types-overview.png[]

Clicking on the "Create a custom data type" will open the data type editor where you can start creating your custom data type.

.Creating a new data type
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-data-types-empty-create.gif[]

A model with at least one custom data type will show a different view.
The following image shows all its elements.

.Empty data types tab overview
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-data-types-with-types-overview.png[]

. Filter -> It filters the custom data type list (*4*), showing only the custom data types that match the filter text.
+
. Add button -> Clicking on the add button, a new custom data type will be created.
+

.Adding data type
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-data-types-new.png[width=300px]
+
. Add options -> Gives the possibility to paste a custom data type that was previously copied to the clipboard.
+
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-data-types-with-types-paste-dropdown.png[width=300px]
+
. Custom data type list -> Shows a list of all custom data types of the current and external models.
+
. Name -> The custom data type name.
It has a uniqueness validation, meaning that it's not possible to rename a custom data type to a name already being used by another data type.
+
. Custom data type options -> Gives the option to delete or copy the data type to the clipboard.
Also, it shows the custom data type id.
+
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-data-types-with-types-type-options.png[width=300px]
+
. Description -> Gives the option to write a more detailed description of the custom data type.
+
. Is Collection -> Change the custom data type to a collection.
+
. Is Struct -> Change the custom data type to a struct.
By making this change, it will show off the struct properties.
+
.Struct data type without properties
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-data-types-with-types-struct-empty-overview.png[width=720p]

[lowerroman,start=1]
. Adds a new property to the struct data type.
A structure with properties will have a few more elements to pay attention to.
+
.Struct data type without properties
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-data-types-with-types-struct-overview.png[width=720p]

[loweralpha]
. Adds a new property to the struct, but now we have an additional button on the bottom of the list.
. For nested structs, this button will add a new property to the nested struct.
. The properties' names.
. The nested properties name.
. Tells if the struct properties are nested structs.
. The type of the struct property.
. Tells if the struct properties are collections.
. The struct properties constraints.
By clicking on it, it will open the property data type, enabling you to edit it.
By opening the struct property, navigation appears on top of it, making it easier to access and visualize the hierarchy.
+
.Struct property navigation
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-data-types-with-types-struct-nested-properties.png[width=720px]
+
. The struct property options.
We have the option to open a detailed view of the property.
The "Extract data type" option creates a new custom data type with the property name.
The copy, cut, and remove are straightforward.
+
.Struct property options
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-data-types-with-types-struct-property-options.png[width=300px]

+
.Struct data type without properties
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-data-types-with-types-struct-paste.png[width=300px]

[start=10]
. Base type -> The base type of the custom data type.
Its options are the base, custom, and external data types.
+
. Constraint -> The base type constraints.
We have the expression constraint which accepts a FEEL expression, the enumeration which creates a list of possible values, and the range which creates a range of possible values.
The last two create the equivalent FEEL expression as well.
Depending on the base type, the enumeration and range will not be available.

[id="included-models"]
=== C. Included models

By default, there is no included model and you should see an empty state screen on the **Included models** tab.

.Including external models
image::tools/authoringDecisions/included-models-tab-empty-state.png[Included models tab empty state]

To include an initial model, click the **(1) Include model** button.
Once the button was clicked a modal will appear.
The modal allows you to include all **DMN** and **PMML** models from the current workspace.

image::tools/authoringDecisions/included-models-tab-modal.png[Include model modal]

**(1) all models** is the current workspace name indicator.
The **all models** is the workspace name used only for this demo.
You can choose any workspace name you need.

**(2) Model** is a dropdown that will list all **DMN** and **PMML** models from the **all models** workspace.

**(3) Name** is a namespace we give to the included model, which will be used for referencing included nodes and data types.

NOTE: With DMN 1.5 leaving this empty will use the <<import-to-default-namespace, default namespace>> feature.

**(4) Include model** is the button for confirming the include operation.
Upon confirmation, the selected model(s) will be displayed below the **Included models** tab as a card.

.Included model cards
image::tools/authoringDecisions/included-models-tab-cards.png[Included models cards]

**(1)** indicates the number of included models in your model.
The number **3** indicates three included models.

**(2)** is a card displaying details of the included model.

**(3)** is the namespace given to the included model.
We can change the namespace **includedLogic** by double-clicking on this value and typing a new namespace value.

**(4)** gives an option to remove the included model.

**(5)** is a card displaying an included model not found in the current workspace.

== Classic DMN editor

This section covers the Classic DMN Editor.

.. Included Models → Lets you manage other Decisions you linked to your current Decision.
   Including a Decision lets you reuse nodes and Data Types from it.
. *Search button →* Lets you search specific elements of your Decision.
. *Side panel strip* → Lets you select which side panel you want to toggle.
  From top to bottom, those are the available panels:
[loweralpha]
.. Navigator → Displays all the elements of your Decision organized by DRG and DRDs, and types.
.. Properties → Lets you manage the properties of a Decision element.
.. Preview → Displays a minimap of your DRG.
. *Node palette →* From here you can select nodes and drag them into your DRG or DRDs.
. *Keyboard shortcuts panel toggle →* Clicking here toggles a panel with information of keyboard shortcuts available on the DMN Editor.

The DMN Editor lets you develop Decisions and Business Knowledge Models (BKMs) using the DMN Boxed Expression Editor.
Drag a new Decision or BKM node to the DRG and let's open it with the DMN Boxed Expression Editor.

image:tools/authoringDecisions/legacy-editor-decision-node.png[tools/image6,width=181,height=100] image:tools/authoringDecisions/legacy-editor-bkm-node.png[tools/image2,width=187,height=103]

_Decision and Business Knowledge Model on the DMN Editor, side by side, showing their Edit button, that brings you to their implementations inside the Boxed Expression Editor, on {CANVAS}._

Selecting Edit on a new Decision will bring you to an empty Boxed Expression.
On a new BKM you'll have an empty Boxed Function.
The implementation of this Boxed Function can be of any type.

.Boxed Expression Editor for a new BKM inside the DMN Editor on {CANVAS}
image::tools/authoringDecisions/legacy-editor-bkm-boxed-expression-editor.png[width=300]

.Boxed Expression Editor for a new Decision inside the DMN Editor on {CANVAS}
image::tools/authoringDecisions/legacy-editor-decision-boxed-expression-editor.png[width=300]

Selecting a Boxed Expression type will update the implementation of the Decision or BKM.

Here's an example Decision Table.

.Boxed Expression implementation example for a Loan Pre-Qualification Decision inside the DMN Editor, on {CANVAS}
image::tools/authoringDecisions/legacy-editor-decision-table.png[]

And a BKM with a Literal implementation.

.Boxed Expression implementation example for a PITI BKM inside the DMN Editor, on {CANVAS}
image::tools/authoringDecisions/legacy-editor-boxed-function.png[width=500]

The Boxed Expression Editor is very capable, and can handle complex implementations.
It's built based on the same Table component {CANVAS} uses on DMN Runner, so you'll feel at home in both places.

Developing Decisions through DMN files is a complex subject and has many intricacies that are out of the scope of this document.
Please refer to DMN-specific material, like the https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.3/PDF[DMN specification] itself.
