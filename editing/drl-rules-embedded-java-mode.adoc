= Executing Rules in embedded Java mode

Building a DRL based project makes use of Apache Maven and aligns with standard Apache Maven practices.

These projects or modules are simply an Apache Maven Java project or module; with an additional metadata: file `META-INF/kmodule.xml`.

The `kmodule.xml` file is the descriptor that selects resources to knowledge bases and configures those bases and sessions.

While standard Apache Maven can build and package these resources, it will not provide validation at build time.

There is an Apache Maven plugin (`kie-maven-plugin`) which is recommended to use to get build time validation.

The plugin also generates many classes, making the runtime loading faster too.

== kmodule.xml
Since meaningful defaults have been provided for all configuration aspects, the simplest `kmodule.xml` file can contain just an empty kmodule tag like the following:

.An empty kmodule.xml example
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<kmodule xmlns="http://www.drools.org/xsd/kmodule"/>
----

In this way the kmodule will contain one single default `KieBase`.
All KIE assets stored under the resources folder, or any of its subfolders, will be compiled and added to it.
To trigger the building of these artifacts it is enough to create a `KieContainer` for them.

.Creating a KieContainer that reads the files to be built from the classpath
[source,java]
----
KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get();
KieContainer kieContainer = kieServices.getKieClasspathContainer();
----

`KieServices` is the interface from where it is possible to access all the KIE building and runtime facilities.
In the code above, all the Java sources and the KIE resources are compiled and deployed into the `KieContainer` which makes its contents available for use at runtime.

The `kmodule.xml` allows to define and configure one or more `KieBase` s and for each `KieBase` all the different `KieSession` s that can be created from it, as showed by the {DROOLS_DOCS_LINK}/KIE/index.html#_thekmodulexmlfile[example].
Then it is possible to simply retrieve the `KieBase` s and `KieSession` s from the `KieContainer` using their names.

.Obtaining KieBase and KieSession using their names from kmodule.xml
[source,java]
----
KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get();
KieContainer kieContainer = kieServices.getKieClasspathContainer();

KieBase kieBase1 = kieContainer.getKieBase("KBase1");
KieSession kieSession1 = kieContainer.newKieSession("KSession2_1");
StatelessKieSession kieSession2 = kieContainer.newStatelessKieSession("KSession2_2");
----


== pom.xml
To run decision in embedded java mode, we will need to use `kie-maven-plugin` in our project.
Also a few KIE specific dependencies are needed.
Ensure to update your `pom.xml` in the following way:

  </build>
----


== KieBase
The `KieBase` is a repository of all the application's knowledge definitions.
It will contain rules, processes, functions, and type models.
The `KieBase` itself does not contain data; instead, sessions are created from the `KieBase` into which data can be inserted and from which process instances may be started.
The `KieBase` can be obtained from the `KieContainer` containing the `KieModule` where the `KieBase` has been defined.

[source,java]
----
KieBase kieBase = kieContainer.getKieBase();
----


== KieSession
The `KieSession` stores and executes on the runtime data.
It is created from the `KieBase` and has two implementations.

=== Stateful
The first session {DROOLS_DOCS_LINK}/rule-engine/index.html#kie-sessions-stateful-con_rule-engine[stateful].
It is obtained using the `newKieSession()` method.
Stateful sessions can be worked with iteratively over time.

[source,java]
----
KieSession kieSession = kieBase.newKieSession();
----

=== Stateless
The session is {DROOLS_DOCS_LINK}/rule-engine/index.html#kie-sessions-stateless-con_rule-engine[stateless].
It is obtained using `newStatelessKieSession()` method.
Stateless is a one-off execution of a `KieRuntime` with a provided data set.
It may return some results, with the session being disposed at the end, prohibiting further iterative interactions.
You can think of stateless as treating an engine like a function call with optional return results.

[source,java]
----
StatelessKieSession kieSession = kieBase.newStatelessKieSession();
----


== KieRuntime
The `KieRuntime` provides methods that are applicable to both rules and processes, such as setting globals and registering channels.
("Exit point" is an obsolete synonym for "channel".)

==== Globals
Globals are named objects that are made visible to the Drools rule engine, but in a way that is fundamentally different from the one for facts: changes in the object backing a global do not trigger reevaluation of rules.
Still, globals are useful for providing static information, as an object offering services that are used in the RHS of a rule, or as a means to return objects from the Drools rule engine.
When you use a global on the LHS of a rule, make sure it is immutable, or, at least, do not expect changes to have any effect on the behavior of your rules.

A global must be declared in a rules file, then it needs to be backed up with a Java object.

[source]
----
global java.util.List list
----

With the `KieBase` now aware of the global identifier and its type, it is now possible to call `ksession.setGlobal()` with the global\'s name and an object, for any session, to associate the object with the global.
Failure to declare the global type and identifier in DRL code will result in an exception being thrown from this call.

[source,java]
----
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
kieSession.setGlobal("list", list);
----

Make sure to set any global before it is used in the evaluation of a rule.
Otherwise a `NullPointerException` will be thrown.


== Event Model
The event package provides means to be notified of Drools rule engine events, including rules firing, objects being asserted, etc.
This allows separation of logging and auditing activities from the main part of your application (and the rules).

The `KieRuntimeEventManager` interface is implemented by the `KieRuntime` which provides two interfaces, `RuleRuntimeEventManager` and `ProcessEventManager`.
We will only cover the `RuleRuntimeEventManager` here.

The `RuleRuntimeEventManager` allows for listeners to be added and removed, so that events for the working memory and the agenda can be listened to.

The following code snippet shows how a simple agenda listener is declared and attached to a session.
It will print matches after they have fired.

[source,java]
----
kieSession.addEventListener(new DefaultAgendaEventListener() {
    public void afterMatchFired(AfterMatchFiredEvent event) {
        super.afterMatchFired(event);
        System.out.println(event);
    }
});
----

Drools also provides `DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener` and `DebugAgendaEventListener` which implement each method with a debug print statement.
To print all Working Memory events, you add a listener like this:

[source,java]
----
kieSession.addEventListener(new DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener());
----

All emitted events implement the `KieRuntimeEvent` interface which can be used to retrieve the actual `KnowlegeRuntime` the event originated from.

NOTE: To see available events browse `org.kie.api.event.rule` https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-drools/tree/main/kie-api/src/main/java/org/kie/api/event/rule[package].



== KieRuntimeLogger
The `KieRuntimeLogger` uses the comprehensive event system in Drools to create an audit log that can be used to log the execution of an application for later inspection.

[source,java]
----
KieRuntimeLogger logger = KieServices.Factory.get().getLoggers().newFileLogger(kieSession, "logdir/mylogfile");
// ... kieSession in action ...
logger.close();
----


== Commands and the CommandExecutor
Both the stateful and stateless session interfaces extend the `CommandExecutor` interface.
The `CommandExecutor` allows for commands to be executed on those sessions, the only difference being that the `StatelessKieSession` executes `fireAllRules()` at the end before disposing the session.
The commands can be created using the https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-drools/blob/main/kie-internal/src/main/java/org/kie/internal/command/CommandFactory.java[`CommandFactory`].

[source,java]
----
ExecutionResults executionResults = statelessKieSession.execute(
    CommandFactory.newBatchExecution(Arrays.asList(
        CommandFactory.newInsert(new Applicant("#0001", 20), "applicant"),
        CommandFactory.newInsert(new LoanApplication("#0001"), "application"),
        new SetActiveAgendaGroup("applicationGroup")           
      )
    )
);

executionResults.getResults().get("application");    
----

The previous example executes a single command.
The `BatchExecution` represents a composite command, created from a list of commands.
It will iterate over the list and execute each command in turn.
This means you can insert some objects, start a process, call `fireAllRules` and execute a query, all in a single `execute(…​)` call, which is quite powerful.

The `StatelessKieSession` will execute `fireAllRules()` automatically at the end.
However the keen-eyed reader probably has already noticed the `FireAllRules` command and wondered how that works with a `StatelessKieSession`.
The `FireAllRules` command is allowed, and using it will disable the automatic execution at the end; think of using it as a sort of manual override function.

Any command, in the batch, that has an out identifier set will add its results to the returned `ExecutionResults` instance.
See the `"applicant"` and `"application"` identifiers in our example.
