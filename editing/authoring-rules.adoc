== Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules

DRL (Drools Rule Language) rules are business rules that you define directly in `.drl` text files. A DRL file can contain one or more rules that define at a minimum the rule conditions (`when`) and actions (`then`).

{PRODUCT} supports several assets that you can use to define business decisions for your decision service. Each decision-authoring asset has different advantages, and you might prefer to use one or a combination of multiple assets depending on your goals and needs.

The following table highlights the main decision-authoring assets supported in _Business Service_ projects to help you decide or confirm the best method for defining decisions in your decision service.

The following example DRL rule determines the age limit in a loan application decision service:

.Example rule for loan application age limit
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
rule "Underage"
  salience 15
  agenda-group "applicationGroup"
  when
    $application : LoanApplication()
    Applicant( age < 21 )
  then
    $application.setApproved( false );
    $application.setExplanation( "Underage" );
end
----

A DRL file can contain single or multiple rules, queries, and functions, and can define resource declarations such as imports, globals, and attributes that are assigned and used by your rules and queries. The DRL package must be listed at the top of a DRL file and the rules are typically listed last. All other DRL components can follow any order.

Each rule must have a unique name within the rule package. If you use the same rule name more than once in any DRL file in the package, the rules fail to compile. Always enclose rule names with double quotation marks (`rule "rule name"`) to  prevent possible compilation errors, especially if you use spaces in rule names.

All data objects related to a DRL rule must be in the same project package as the DRL file in {CANVAS}. Assets in the same package are imported by default. Existing assets in other packages can be imported with the DRL rule.

== Spreadsheet Decision Tables

[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of business decisions, you can define business rules in a tabular format in spreadsheet Decision Tables and then include the spreadsheet file in your _Business Service_ project. These rules are compiled into Drools Rule Language (DRL) for the decision service in your project.

=== Spreadsheet Decision Tables

[role="_abstract"]
Spreadsheet Decision Tables are spreadsheet files (XLS or XLSX) that contain business rules defined in a tabular format. You can include spreadsheet Decision Tables as part of your _Business Service_ project. Each row in a spreadsheet Decision Table is a rule, and each column is a condition, an action, or another rule attribute. After you create and include your spreadsheet Decision Tables in your project, the rules you defined are compiled into Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules for the Decision service.

=== Decision Table use case

[role="_abstract"]
An online shopping site lists the shipping charges for ordered items. The site provides free shipping under the following conditions:

* The number of items ordered is 4 or more and the checkout total is $300 or more.
* Standard shipping is selected (4 or 5 business days from the date of purchase).

The following are the shipping rates under these conditions:

In order for a Decision Table to be compiled in your _Business Service_ project, the table must comply with certain structure and syntax requirements within an spreadsheet, as shown in this example.

=== Creating spreadsheet Decision Tables for your _Business Service_ project

[role="_abstract"]
Spreadsheet Decision Tables (XLS or XLSX) require two key areas that define rule data: a `RuleSet` area and a `RuleTable` area. The `RuleSet` area of the spreadsheet defines elements that you want to apply globally to all rules in the same package (not only the spreadsheet), such as a rule set name or universal rule attributes. The `RuleTable` area defines the actual rules (rows) and the conditions, actions, and other rule attributes (columns) that constitute that rule table within the specified rule set. A spreadsheet of decision tables can contain multiple `RuleTable` areas, but only one `RuleSet` area.

IMPORTANT: For each _Business Service_ project, try to include only one spreadsheet of decision tables, containing all necessary `RuleTable` definitions. Although you can include separate decision table spreadsheets, including multiple spreadsheets in the same project package can cause compilation errors from conflicting `RuleSet` or `RuleTable` attributes and is therefore not recommended.

Using the example in the previous section, <<spreadsheet_decision_table_example>>, create a decision table from the spreadsheet.

.Prerequisites
* You have the following dependency added to the `pom.xml` file of your _Business Service_ project to enable decision tables for decision services:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
  <artifactId>drools-decisiontables</artifactId>
</dependency>
----



.Procedure
. In a new spreadsheet, go to the second or third column and label a cell `RuleSet` (row 1 in example). Reserve the column or columns to the left for descriptive metadata (optional).
. In the next cell to the right, enter a name for the `RuleSet`. This named rule set will contain all `RuleTable` rules defined in the rule package.
. Under the `RuleSet` cell, define any rule attributes (one per cell) that you want to apply globally to all rule tables in the package. Specify attribute values in the cells to the right. For example, you can enter an `Import` label and in the cell to the right, specify relevant data objects from other packages that you want to import into the package for the decision table (in the format `package.name.object.name`).
. Below the `RuleSet` area and in the same column as the `RuleSet` cell, skip a row and label a new cell `RuleTable` (row 7 in example) and enter a table name in the same cell. The name is used as the initial part of the name for all rules derived from this rule table, with the row number appended for distinction. You can override this automatic naming by inserting a `NAME` attribute column.
. Use the next four rows to define the following elements as needed (rows 8-11 in example):
+
* *Rule attributes:* Conditions, actions, or other attributes.
* *Object types:* The data objects to which the rule attributes apply. If the same object type applies to multiple columns, merge the object cells into one cell across multiple columns (as shown in the sample decision table), instead of repeating the object type in multiple cells. When an object type is merged, all columns below the merged range will be combined into one set of constraints within a single pattern for matching a single fact at a time. When an object is repeated in separate columns, the separate columns can create different patterns, potentially matching different or identical facts.
* *Constraints:* Constraints on the object types.
* *Column label:* (Optional) Any descriptive label for the column, as a visual aid. Leave blank if unused.
+
NOTE: As an alternative to populating both the object type and constraint cells, you can leave the object type cell or cells empty and enter the full expression in the corresponding constraint cell or cells. For example, instead of `Order` as the object type and `itemsCount > $1` as a constraint (separate cells), you can leave the object type cell empty and enter `Order( itemsCount > $1 )` in the constraint cell, and then do the same for other constraint cells.

+
. After you have defined all necessary rule attributes (columns), enter values for each column as needed, row by row, to generate rules (rows 12-17 in example). Cells with no data are ignored (such as when a condition or action does not apply).
+
If you need to add more rule tables to this decision table spreadsheet, skip a row after the last rule in the previous table, label another `RuleTable` cell in the same column as the previous `RuleTable` and  `RuleSet` cells, and create the new table following the same steps in this section (rows 19-29 in example).
. Save your spreadsheet to finish.
. In your VS Code IDE, import the spreadsheet file in the relevant folder of your _Business Service_ project, typically in `src/main/resources`.

NOTE: Only the first worksheet in a spreadsheet workbook is processed as a decision table when you include the spreadsheet in your _Business Service_ project. Each `RuleSet` name combined with the `RuleTable` name must be unique across all decision table files in the same package.

After you include the decision table in your _Business Service_ project, the rules are interpreted as DRL rules like the following example, from the sample spreadsheet:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
//row 12
rule "Basic_12"
salience 10
  when
    $order : /orders[ itemsCount > 0, itemsCount <= 3, deliverInDays == 1 ]
  then
    insert( new Charge( 35 ) );
end
----

[NOTE]
.Enabling white space used in cell values
====
By default, any white space before or after values in decision table cells is removed before the decision table is processed by the decision engine. To retain white space that you use intentionally before or after values in cells, set the `drools.trimCellsInDTable` system property to `false` in the `application.properties` file of your _Business Service_ project:

.Enable white space in `application.properties`
[source]
----
drools.trimCellsInDTable=false
----

You can also set this property as a start-up option when you build your _Business Service_ project:

.On Quarkus

[source,shell]
----
mvn compile quarkus:dev -Ddrools.trimCellsInDTable=false
----
====

=== RuleSet definitions

[role="_abstract"]
Entries in the `RuleSet` area of a decision table define DRL constructs and rule attributes that you want to apply to all rules in a package (not only in the spreadsheet). Entries must be in a vertically stacked sequence of cell pairs, where the first cell contains a label and the cell to the right contains the value. A decision table spreadsheet can have only one `RuleSet` area.

The following table lists the supported labels and values for `RuleSet` definitions:

.Supported `RuleSet` definitions
[cols="30%,40%,30%", options="header"]
|===
|Label |Value |Usage

|`RuleSet`
|The package name for the generated DRL file. Optional, the default is `rule_table`.
|Must be the first entry.

|`Unit`
|The name of the rule unit for the generated DRL file.
|Recommended for optimal rule grouping and execution.

|`Sequential`
|`true` or `false`. If `true`, then salience is used to ensure that rules fire from the top down.
|Optional, at most once. If omitted, no firing order is imposed.

|`SequentialMaxPriority`
|Integer numeric value.
|Optional, at most once. In sequential mode, this option is used to set the start value of the salience. If omitted, the default value is `65535`.

|`SequentialMinPriority`
|Integer numeric value.
|Optional, at most once. In sequential mode, this option is used to check if this minimum salience value is not violated. If omitted, the default value is `0`.

|`EscapeQuotes`
|`true` or `false`. If `true`, then quotation marks are escaped so that they appear literally in the DRL.
|Optional, at most once. If omitted, quotation marks are escaped.

|`Import`
|A comma-separated list of Java classes to import from another package.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.

|`Queries`
|One or more query definitions, according to DRL syntax.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.

|`Declare`
|One or more declarative types, according to DRL syntax.
|Optional, may be used repeatedly.
|===

WARNING: In some cases, Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, and OpenOffice might encode a double quotation mark differently, causing a compilation error. For example, `"`A`"` fails, but `"A"` succeeds.

=== RuleTable definitions

[role="_abstract"]
Entries in the `RuleTable` area of a decision table define conditions, actions, and other rule attributes for the rules in that rule table. A spreadsheet of decision tables can contain multiple `RuleTable` areas.

The following table lists the supported labels (column headers) and values for `RuleTable` definitions. For column headers, you can use either the given labels or any custom labels that begin with the letters listed in the table.

.Supported `RuleTable` definitions
[cols="25%,20%,35%,20%", options="header"]
|===
|Label |Or custom label that begins with |Value |Usage

|`NAME`
|N
|Provides the name for the rule generated from that row. The default is constructed from the text following the `RuleTable` tag and the row number.
|At most one column.

|`DESCRIPTION`
|I
|Results in a comment within the generated rule.
|At most one column.

|`CONDITION`
|C
|Code snippet and interpolated values for constructing a constraint within a pattern in a condition.
|At least one per rule table.

|`ACTION`
|A
|Code snippet and interpolated values for constructing an action for the consequence of the rule.
|At least one per rule table.

|`METADATA`
|@
|Code snippet and interpolated values for constructing a metadata entry for the rule.
|Optional, any number of columns.
|===

The following sections provide more details about how condition, action, and metadata columns use cell data:

Conditions::

For columns headed `CONDITION`, the cells in consecutive lines result in a conditional element:

* *First cell:* Text in the first cell below `CONDITION` develops into a pattern for the rule condition, and uses the snippet in the next line as a constraint. If the cell is merged with one or more neighboring cells, a single pattern with multiple constraints is formed. All constraints are combined into a parenthesized list and appended to the text in this cell.
+
If this cell is empty, the code snippet in the cell below it must result in a valid conditional element on its own. For example, instead of `Order` as the object type and `itemsCount > $1` as a constraint (separate cells), you can leave the object type cell empty and enter `Order( itemsCount > $1 )` in the constraint cell, and then do the same for any other constraint cells.
+
To include a pattern without constraints, you can write the pattern in front of the text of another pattern, with or without an empty pair of parentheses. You can also append a `from` clause to the pattern.
+
If the pattern ends with `eval`, code snippets produce boolean expressions for inclusion into a pair of parentheses after `eval`.
* *Second cell:* Text in the second cell below `CONDITION` is processed as a constraint on the object reference in the first cell. The code snippet in this cell is modified by interpolating values from cells farther down in the column. If you want to create a constraint consisting of a comparison using `==` with the value from the cells below, then the field selector alone is sufficient. Any other comparison operator must be specified as the last item within the snippet, and the value from the cells below is appended. For all other constraint forms, you must mark the position for including the contents of a cell with the symbol `$param`. Multiple insertions are possible if you use the symbols `$1`, `$2`, and so on, and a comma-separated list of values in the cells below. However, do not separate `$1`, `$2`, and so on, by commas, or the table will fail to process.
+
To expand a text according to the pattern `forall($delimiter){$snippet}`, repeat the `$snippet` once for each of the values of the comma-separated list in each of the cells below, insert the value in place of the symbol `$`, and join these expansions by the given `$delimiter`. Note that the `forall` construct may be surrounded by other text.
+
If the first cell contains an object, the completed code snippet is added to the conditional element from that cell. A pair of parentheses is provided automatically, as well as a separating comma if multiple constraints are added to a pattern in a merged cell. If the first cell is empty, the code snippet in this cell must result in a valid conditional element on its own. For example, instead of `Order` as the object type and `itemsCount > $1` as a constraint (separate cells), you can leave the object type cell empty and enter `Order( itemsCount > $1 )` in the constraint cell, and then do the same for any other constraint cells.
* *Third cell:* Text in the third cell below `CONDITION` is a descriptive label that you define for the column, as a visual aid.
* *Fourth cell:* From the fourth row on, non-blank entries provide data for interpolation. A blank cell omits the condition or constraint for this rule.

Actions::

For columns headed `ACTION`, the cells in consecutive lines result in an action statement:

* *First cell:* Text in the first cell below `ACTION` is optional. If present, the text is interpreted as an object reference.
* *Second cell:* Text in the second cell below `ACTION` is a code snippet that is modified by interpolating values from cells farther down in the column. For a singular insertion, mark the position for including the contents of a cell with the symbol `$param`. Multiple insertions are possible if you use the symbols `$1`, `$2`, and so on, and a comma-separated list of values in the cells below. However, do not separate `$1`, `$2`, and so on, by commas, or the table will fail to process.
+
A text without any marker symbols can execute a method call without interpolation. In this case, use any non-blank entry in a row below the cell to include the statement. The `forall` construct is supported.
+
If the first cell contains an object, then the cell text (followed by a period), the text in the second cell, and a terminating semicolon are strung together, resulting in a method call that is added as an action statement for the consequence. If the first cell is empty, the code snippet in this cell must result in a valid action element on its own.
* *Third cell:* Text in the third cell below `ACTION` is a descriptive label that you define for the column, as a visual aid.
* *Fourth cell:* From the fourth row on, non-blank entries provide data for interpolation. A blank cell omits the condition or constraint for this rule.

Metadata::

For columns headed `METADATA`, the cells in consecutive lines result in a metadata annotation for the generated rules:

* *First cell:* Text in the first cell below `METADATA` is ignored.
* *Second cell:* Text in the second cell below `METADATA` is subject to interpolation, using values from the cells in the rule rows. The metadata marker character `@` is prefixed automatically, so you do not need to include that character in the text for this cell.
* *Third cell:* Text in the third cell below `METADATA` is a descriptive label that you define for the column, as a visual aid.
* *Fourth cell:* From the fourth row on, non-blank entries provide data for interpolation. A blank cell results in the omission of the metadata annotation for this rule.

=== Additional rule attributes for RuleSet or RuleTable definitions

[role="_abstract"]
The `RuleSet` and `RuleTable` areas also support labels and values for other rule attributes, such as `PRIORITY` or `NO-LOOP`. Rule attributes specified in a `RuleSet` area will affect all rule assets in the same package (not only in the spreadsheet). Rule attributes specified in a `RuleTable` area will affect only the rules in that rule table. You can use each rule attribute only once in a `RuleSet` area and once in a `RuleTable` area. If the same attribute is used in both `RuleSet` and `RuleTable` areas within the spreadsheet, then `RuleTable` takes priority and the attribute in the `RuleSet` area is overridden.

The following table lists the supported labels (column headers) and values for additional `RuleSet` or `RuleTable` definitions. For column headers, you can use either the given labels or any custom labels that begin with the letters listed in the table.

.Additional rule attributes for `RuleSet` or `RuleTable` definitions
[cols="25%,20%,55%", options="header"]
|===
|Label
|Or custom label that begins with
|Value

|`PRIORITY`
|P
|An integer defining the `salience` value of the rule. Rules with a higher salience value are given higher priority when ordered in the activation queue. Overridden by the `Sequential` flag.

Example: `PRIORITY 10`

|`DATE-EFFECTIVE`
|V
|A string containing a date and time definition. The rule can be activated only if the current date and time is after a `DATE-EFFECTIVE` attribute.

Example: `DATE-EFFECTIVE "4-Sep-2018"`

|`DATE-EXPIRES`
|Z
|A string containing a date and time definition. The rule cannot be activated if the current date and time is after the `DATE-EXPIRES` attribute.

Example: `DATE-EXPIRES "4-Oct-2018"`

|`NO-LOOP`
|U
|A Boolean value. When this option is set to `true`, the rule cannot be reactivated (looped) if a consequence of the rule re-triggers a previously met condition.

Example: `NO-LOOP true`

|`ACTIVATION-GROUP`
|X
|A string identifying an activation (or XOR) group to which you want to assign the rule. In activation groups, only one rule can be activated. The first rule to fire will cancel all pending activations of all rules in the activation group.

Example: `ACTIVATION-GROUP "GroupName"`

|`DURATION`
|D
|A long integer value defining the duration of time in milliseconds after which the rule can be activated, if the rule conditions are still met.

Example: `DURATION 10000`

|`TIMER`
|T
|A string identifying either `int` (interval) or `cron` timer definitions for scheduling the rule.

Example: `TIMER "*/5 * * * *"`  (every 5 minutes)

|`CALENDAR`
|E
|A Quartz calendar definition for scheduling the rule.

Example: `CALENDAR "* * 0-7,18-23 ? * *"`  (exclude non-business hours)

|`AUTO-FOCUS`
|F
|A Boolean value, applicable only to rules within agenda groups. When this option is set to `true`, the next time the rule is activated, a focus is automatically given to the agenda group to which the rule is assigned.

Example: `AUTO-FOCUS true`

|`LOCK-ON-ACTIVE`
|L
|A Boolean value, applicable only to rules within rule flow groups or agenda groups. When this option is set to `true`, the next time the ruleflow group for the rule becomes active or the agenda group for the rule receives a focus, the rule cannot be activated again until the ruleflow group is no longer active or the agenda group loses the focus. This is a stronger version of the `no-loop` attribute, because the activation of a matching rule is discarded regardless of the origin of the update (not only by the rule itself). This attribute is ideal for calculation rules where you have a number of rules that modify a fact and you do not want any rule re-matching and firing again.

Example: `LOCK-ON-ACTIVE true`
