[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of business decisions, you can use Decision Model and Notation (DMN) to model a decision service graphically. The decision requirements of a DMN decision model are determined by a decision requirements graph (DRG) that is depicted in one or more decision requirements diagrams (DRDs). A DRD can represent part or all of the overall DRG for the DMN model. DRDs trace business decisions from start to finish, with each decision node using logic defined in DMN boxed expressions such as decision tables.

You can design your DMN models with {CANVAS} or import existing DMN models into your {PRODUCT} projects for deployment and execution. 

For more information about DMN, see the Object Management Group (OMG) https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].

== Decision Model and Notation (DMN)

[role="_abstract"]
Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is a standard established by the https://www.omg.org/[Object Management Group (OMG)] for describing and modeling operational decisions. DMN defines an XML schema that enables DMN models to be shared between DMN-compliant platforms and across organizations so that business analysts and business rules developers can collaborate in designing and implementing DMN decision services. The DMN standard is similar to and can be used together with the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard for designing and modeling business processes.

For more information about the background and applications of DMN, see the OMG https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].

=== DMN decision logic in boxed expressions

[role="_abstract"]
Boxed expressions in DMN are tables that you use to define the underlying logic of decision nodes and business knowledge models in a decision requirements diagram (DRD). Some boxed expressions can contain other boxed expressions, but the top-level boxed expression corresponds to the decision logic of a single DRD artifact. While DRDs represent the flow of a DMN decision model, boxed expressions define the actual decision logic of individual nodes. DRDs and boxed expressions together form a complete and functional DMN decision model.

The following are the types of DMN boxed expressions:

* <<con-dmn-decision-tables>>
* <<con-dmn-literal-expressions>>
* <<con-dmn-context-expressions>>
* <<con-dmn-relation-expressions>>
* <<con-dmn-function-expressions>>
* <<con-dmn-invocation-expressions>>
* <<con-dmn-list-expressions>>
* <<con-dmn-conditional-expressions>>
* <<con-dmn-for-expressions>>
* <<con-dmn-every-expressions>>
* <<con-dmn-some-expressions>>
* <<con-dmn-filter-expressions>>



All Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) expressions that you use in your boxed expressions must conform to the FEEL syntax requirements in the OMG https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].


[id="con-dmn-decision-tables"]
==== DMN decision tables

[role="_abstract"]
A decision table in DMN is a visual representation of one or more business rules in a tabular format. You use decision tables to define rules for a decision node that applies those rules at a given point in the decision model. Each rule consists of a single row in the table, and includes columns that define the conditions (input, light blue in the picture below) and outcome (output, dark blue in the picture below) for that particular row. The definition of each row is precise enough to derive the outcome using the values of the conditions. Input and output values can be FEEL expressions or defined data type values.

For example, the following decision table determines applicant qualification for a loan as the concluding decision node in a loan prequalification decision model:

.Decision table for loan prequalification
image::dmn-decision-table-example3.png[]

Decision tables are a popular way of modeling rules and decision logic, and are used in many methodologies (such as DMN) and implementation frameworks (such as Drools).

IMPORTANT: {PRODUCT} supports both DMN decision tables and Drools-native decision tables, but they are different types of assets with different syntax requirements and are not interchangeable.

[id="con-dmn-decision-tables-hit-policies"]
===== Hit policies in DMN decision tables

[role="_abstract"]
Hit policies determine how to reach an outcome when multiple rules in a decision table match the provided input values. For example, if one rule in a decision table applies a sales discount to military personnel and another rule applies a discount to students, then when a customer is both a student and in the military, the decision table hit policy must indicate whether to apply one discount or the other (*Unique*, *First*) or both discounts (*Collect Sum*). You specify the single character of the hit policy (*U*, *F*, *C+*) in the upper-left corner of the decision table.

The following decision table hit policies are supported in DMN:

* *Unique (U):* Permits only one rule to match. Any overlap raises an error.
* *Any (A):* Permits multiple rules to match, but they must all have the same output. If multiple matching rules do not have the same output, an error is raised.
* *Priority (P):* Permits multiple rules to match, with different outputs. The output that comes first in the output values list is selected.
* *First (F):* Uses the first match in rule order.
* *Collect (C+, C>, C<, C#):* Aggregates output from multiple rules based on an aggregation function.
** *Collect ( C ):* Aggregates values in an arbitrary list.
** *Collect Sum (C+):* Outputs the sum of all collected values. Values must be numeric.
** *Collect Min (C<):* Outputs the minimum value among the matches. The resulting values must be comparable, such as numbers, dates, or text (lexicographic order).
** *Collect Max (C>):* Outputs the maximum value among the matches. The resulting values must be comparable, such as numbers, dates or text (lexicographic order).
** *Collect Count (C#):* Outputs the number of matching rules.

[id="con-dmn-literal-expressions"]
==== Boxed literal expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed literal expression in DMN is a literal FEEL expression as text in a table cell, typically with a labeled column and an assigned data type. You use boxed literal expressions to define simple or complex node logic or decision data directly in FEEL for a particular node in a decision. Literal FEEL expressions must conform to FEEL syntax requirements in the OMG https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].

For example, the following boxed literal expression defines the minimum acceptable PITI calculation (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) in a lending decision, where `acceptable rate` is a variable defined in the DMN model:

.Boxed literal expression for minimum PITI value
image::dmn-literal-expression-example2.png[]

The following boxed literal expression sorts a list of possible dating candidates (soul mates) in an online dating application based on their score on criteria such as age, location, and interests:

.Boxed literal expression for matching online dating candidates
image::dmn-literal-expression-example3b.png[]

[id="con-dmn-context-expressions"]
==== Boxed context expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed context expression in DMN is a set of variable names and values with a result value. Each name-value pair is a context entry. You use context expressions to represent data definitions in decision logic and set a value for a desired decision element within the DMN decision model. A value in a boxed context expression can be a data type value or FEEL expression, or can contain a nested sub-expression of any type, such as a decision table, a literal expression, or another context expression.

For example, the following boxed context expression defines the factors for sorting delayed passengers in a flight-rebooking decision model, based on defined data types (`tPassengerTable`, `tFlightNumberList`):

.Boxed context expression for flight passenger waiting list
image::dmn-context-expression-example.png[]

The following boxed context expression defines the factors that determine whether a loan applicant can meet minimum mortgage payments based on principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI), represented as a front-end ratio calculation with a sub-context expression:

.Boxed context expression for front-end client PITI ratio
image::dmn-context-expression-example2.png[]

[id="con-dmn-relation-expressions"]
==== Boxed relation expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed relation expression in DMN is a traditional data table with information about given entities, listed as rows. You use boxed relation tables to define decision data for relevant entities in a decision at a particular node. Boxed relation expressions are similar to context expressions in that they set variable names and values, but relation expressions contain no result value and list all variable values based on a single defined variable in each column.

For example, the following boxed relation expression provides information about employees in an employee rostering decision:

.Boxed relation expression with employee information
image::dmn-relation-expression-example.png[]

[id="con-dmn-function-expressions"]
==== Boxed function expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed function expression in DMN is a parameterized boxed expression containing a literal FEEL expression, a nested context expression of an external JAVA or PMML function, or a nested boxed expression of any type. By default, all business knowledge models are defined as boxed function expressions. You use boxed function expressions to call functions on your decision logic and to define all business knowledge models.

For example, the following boxed function expression determines airline flight capacity is enough in a flight-rebooking decision model:

[id="flight-capacity-example"]
.Boxed function expression for flight capacity
image::dmn-function-expression-example.png[]

The following boxed function expression contains a basic Java function as a context expression for determining absolute value in a decision model calculation:

.Boxed function expression for absolute value
image::dmn-function-expression-example2.png[]

The following boxed function expression determines a monthly mortgage installment as a business knowledge model in a lending decision, with the function value defined as a nested context expression:

.Boxed function expression for installment calculation in business knowledge model
image::dmn-function-expression-example3.png[]

The following boxed function expression uses a PMML model included in the DMN file to define the minimum acceptable PITI calculation (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) in a lending decision:

[id="con-dmn-invocation-expressions"]
==== Boxed invocation expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed invocation expression in DMN is a boxed expression that invokes a business knowledge model. A boxed invocation expression contains the name of the business knowledge model to be invoked and a list of parameter bindings. Each binding is represented by two boxed expressions on a row: The box on the left contains the name of a parameter and the box on the right contains the binding expression whose value is assigned to the parameter to evaluate the invoked business knowledge model. You use boxed invocations to invoke at a particular decision node a business knowledge model defined in the decision model.

For example, the following boxed invocation expression invokes a `Reassign Next Passenger` business knowledge model as the concluding decision node in a flight-rebooking decision model:

.Boxed invocation expression to reassign flight passengers
image::dmn-invocation-example.png[]

The following boxed invocation expression invokes an `InstallmentCalculation` business knowledge model to calculate a monthly installment amount for a loan before proceeding to affordability decisions:

.Boxed invocation expression for required monthly installment
image::dmn-invocation-example2.png[]

[id="con-dmn-list-expressions"]
==== Boxed list expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed list expression in DMN represents a FEEL list of items. You use boxed lists to define lists of relevant items for a particular node in a decision. You can also use literal FEEL expressions for list items in cells to create more complex lists.

For example, the following boxed list expression identifies approved credit score agencies in a loan application decision service:

.Boxed list expression for approved credit score agencies
image::dmn-list-expression-example.png[]

The following boxed list expression also identifies approved credit score agencies but uses FEEL logic to define the agency status (Inc., LLC, SA, GA) based on a DMN input node:

[id="approved-credit-score-agency-list-example"]
.Boxed list expression using FEEL logic for approved credit score agency status
image::dmn-list-expression-example2.png[]

.DMN diagram for approved credit score agency status
image::dmn-list-expression-example2a.png[]

[id="con-dmn-conditional-expressions"]
==== Boxed conditional expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed conditional offers a visual representation of an `if` statement using three rows.
The expression in the `if` part must resolve to a boolean.
When the `if` resolves to a `true`, `then` part is returned.
When the `if` resolves to a `false`, `else` part is returned.

.Conditional expression of MonthlyFee computation
image::runtime-services-modeling/dmn-conditional-expression.png[]

NOTE: This feature was introduced as part of the {PRODUCT} 9.1 and DMN 1.5 releases.

[id="con-dmn-for-expressions"]
==== Boxed for expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed for offers a visual representation of an iterator statement.
For the `for` loop, the right part of the `for` displays the iterator variable name.
The second row holds an expression representing the collection that will be iterated over.
The expression in the `in` row must resolve to a collection.
The last row contains the expression that will process each element of the collection.

The example below is an alternative way of producing list similar as <<approved-credit-score-agency-list-example>>.

.Iterator expression of Approved credit score agencies
image::runtime-services-modeling/dmn-iterator-expression.png[]

NOTE: This feature was introduced as part of the {PRODUCT} 9.1 and DMN 1.5 releases.

[id="con-dmn-every-expressions"]
==== Boxed every expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed every offers a visual representation of an iterator statement.
For the `every` loop, the right part of the `every` displays the iterator variable name.
The second row holds an expression representing the collection that will be iterated over.
The expression in the `in` row MUST resolve to a collection.
The last line is an expression that will be evaluated on each item.
The expression defined in the `satisfies` must resolve to a boolean.

.Every expression of Will Fly Together decision
image::runtime-services-modeling/dmn-every-expression.png[]

NOTE: This feature was introduced as part of the {PRODUCT} 9.1 and DMN 1.5 releases.

[id="con-dmn-some-expressions"]
==== Boxed some expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed some offers a visual representation of an iterator statement.
For the `some` loop, the right part of the `some` displays the iterator variable name.
The second row holds an expression representing the collection that will be iterated over.
The expression in the `in` row must resolve to a collection.
The last line is an expression that will be evaluated on each item.
The expression defined in the `satisfies` must resolve to a boolean.

.Some expression of Will Not Fly Together decision
image::runtime-services-modeling/dmn-some-expression.png[]

NOTE: This feature was introduced as part of the {PRODUCT} 9.1 and DMN 1.5 releases.

[id="con-dmn-filter-expressions"]
==== Boxed filter expressions

[role="_abstract"]
A boxed filter offers a visual representation of collection filtering.
The top part is an expression that is the collection to be filtered.
The bottom part, between the square brackets, holds the filter expression.

The example below is an alternative way of defining logic as <<flight-capacity-example>>.

.Filter expression of rebooked flights
image::runtime-services-modeling/dmn-filter-expression.png[]

Furthermore, the `filter` expression brings a reserved keyword `item`.
Using this keyword you can explicitly access items from the filtered collection.
Its benefit can be seen more for collections of simple data types (numbers, strings, etc.).

.Filter expression of rebooked flights using item keyword
image::runtime-services-modeling/dmn-filter-expression-item.png[]

There is available source code of the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bamoe/bamoe-docs-source-code-examples/9.1.x/dmn/flight-has-capacity.dmn[Filter expression of rebooked flights using item keyword] example model.


NOTE: This feature was introduced as part of the {PRODUCT} 9.1 and DMN 1.5 releases.

[id="ref-dmn-model-example"]
=== DMN model example

[role="_abstract"]
The following is a real-world DMN model example that demonstrates how you can use decision modeling to reach a decision based on input data, circumstances, and company guidelines. In this scenario, a flight from San Diego to New York is canceled, requiring the affected airline to find alternate arrangements for its inconvenienced passengers.

First, the airline collects the information necessary to determine how best to get the travelers to their destinations:

Input data::
* List of flights
* List of passengers

Decisions::
* Prioritize the passengers who will get seats on a new flight
* Determine which flights those passengers will be offered

Business knowledge models::
* The company process for determining passenger priority
* Any flights that have space available
* Company rules for determining how best to reassign inconvenienced passengers

The airline then uses the DMN standard to model its decision process in the following decision requirements diagram (DRD) for determining the best rebooking solution:

.DRD for flight rebooking
image::dmn-passenger-rebooking-drd.png[]

Similar to flowcharts, DRDs use shapes to represent the different elements in a process. Ovals contain the two necessary input data, rectangles contain the decision points in the model, and rectangles with clipped corners (business knowledge models) contain reusable logic that can be repeatedly invoked.

The DRD draws logic for each element from boxed expressions that provide variable definitions using FEEL expressions or data type values.

Some boxed expressions are basic, such as the following decision for establishing a prioritized waiting list:

.Boxed context expression example for prioritized wait list
image::dmn-context-expression-example.png[]

Some boxed expressions are more complex with greater detail and calculation, such as the following business knowledge model for reassigning the next delayed passenger:

.Boxed function expression for passenger reassignment
image::dmn-reassign-passenger.png[]

You can find the DMN source file for this decision model on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-kie-drools/{DROOLS_VERSION}/kie-dmn/kie-dmn-core/src/test/resources/org/kie/dmn/core/0019-flight-rebooking.dmn[**github**].


[id="con-dmn-validation"]
=== Configurable DMN validation in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
By default, the {PRODUCT} CodeGen component uses the `kogito.decisions.validation=ENABLED` configuration to perform pre-compilation validation of DMN model assets and to perform DMN decision table static analysis.

When this configuration is enabled, {PRODUCT} performs the following DMN validations:

* DMN model files are verified against the DMN specification XSD schema to ensure that the files are valid XML and compliant with the specification.
* The pre-compilation analysis is performed for the DMN model to ensure that the basic semantic is aligned with the DMN specification.
* DMN decision tables are statically analyzed for gaps or overlaps and to ensure that the semantic of the decision table follows best practices.

Any DMN validation error causes the {PRODUCT} CodeGen build to fail and errors are reported accordingly, as shown in the following example:

.DMN validation errors
image::kogito-dmn-validation-con-error.png[Image of DMN validation errors]

You can modify the default DMN validation and DMN decision table analysis behavior to ignore errors during the project build, or you can disable this default behavior completely, as shown in the following examples:

.Default configuration for DMN validation and decision table analysis
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=ENABLED
----

.Configuration to validate DMN models and DMN decision tables but ignore errors
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=IGNORE
----

.Configuration to disable all DMN validation
[source]
----
kogito.decisions.validation=DISABLED
----

NOTE: If you enter an unrecognized `kogito.decisions.validation` configuration flag, all pre-compilation validation features are disabled and the {PRODUCT} CodeGen emits related log messages.

ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
[id="ref-dmn-feel-enhancements"]
=== FEEL enhancements in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
{PRODUCT} includes the following enhancements and other changes to FEEL in the current DMN implementation:

* _Space Sensitivity_: This DMN implementation of the FEEL language is space insensitive. The goal is to avoid non-deterministic behavior based on the context and differences in behavior based on invisible characters, such as white spaces. This means that for this implementation, a variable named `first name` with one space is exactly the same as `first  name` with two spaces in it.

* __List functions `or()` and `and()` __: The specification defines two list functions named `or()` and `and()`. However,
according to the FEEL grammar, these are not valid function names, as `and` and `or` are reserved keywords.
 This implementation renames these functions to `any()` and `all()` respectively, in anticipation for DMN 1.2.

* __Keyword `in` cannot be used in variable names__: The specification defines that any keyword can be reused as part
 of a variable name, but the ambiguities caused with the `for ... in ... return` loop prevent the reuse of the `in`
 keyword. All other keywords are supported as part of variable names.

* __Keywords are not supported in attributes of anonymous types__: FEEL is not a strongly typed language and the parser must resolve ambiguity in name parts of an attribute of an anonymous type. The parser supports reusable keywords as part of a variable name defined in the scope, but the parser does not support keywords in attributes of an anonymous type. For example, `for item in Order.items return Federal Tax for Item( item )` is a valid and supported FEEL expression, where a function named `Federal Tax for Item(...)` can be defined and invoked correctly in the scope. However, the expression `for i in [ {x and y : true, n : 1}, {x and y : false, n: 2} ] return i.x and y` is not supported because anonymous types are defined in the iteration context of the `for` expression and the parser cannot resolve the ambiguity.

* __Support for date and time literals on ranges__: According to the grammar rules #8, #18, #19, #34 and #62, `date
 and time` literals are supported in ranges (pages 110-111). Chapter 10.3.2.7 on page 114, on the other hand, contradicts
 the grammar and says they are not supported. This implementation chose to follow the grammar and support `date and
 time` literals on ranges, as well as extend the specification to support any arbitrary expression (see extensions below).

* __Invalid time syntax__: Chapter 10.3.2.3.4 on page 112 and bullet point about `time` on page 131 both state that
 the `time` string lexical representation follows the XML Schema Datatypes specification as well as ISO 8601. According
 to the XML Schema specification (https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#time), the lexical representation of a time follows
 the pattern `hh:mm:ss.sss` without any leading character. The DMN specification uses a leading "T" in several examples,
 that we understand is a typo and not in accordance with the standard.

* __Support for scientific and hexadecimal notations__: This implementation supports scientific and hexadecimal
  notation for numbers. For example, `1.2e5` (scientific notation), `0xD5` (hexadecimal notation).

* __Support for expressions as end points in ranges__: This implementation supports expressions as endpoints
  for ranges. For example, `[date("2016-11-24")..date("2016-11-27")]`

* __Support for additional types__: The specification only defines the following as basic types of the language:
  ** number
  ** string
  ** boolean
  ** days and time duration
  ** years and month duration
  ** time
  ** date and time
+
For completeness and orthogonality, this implementation also supports the following types:

  ** context
  ** list
  ** range
  ** function
  ** unary test

* __Support for unary tests__: For completeness and orthogonality, unary tests are supported
  as first class citizens in the language. They are functions with an implicit single
  parameter and can be invoked in the same way as functions. For example,
+
[source,json]
.UnaryTestAsFunction.feel
----
  {
      is minor : < 18,
      Bob is minor : is minor( bob.age )
  }
----

* __Support for additional built-in functions__: The following additional functions are supported:

  ** `now()` : Returns the current local date and time.
  ** `today()` : Returns the current local date.
  ** `decision table()` : Returns a decision table function, although the specification mentions a decision table.
  The function on page 114 is not implementable as defined.
  ** `string( mask, p... )` : Returns a string formatted as per the mask. See Java String.format() for
  details on the mask syntax. For example, `string( "%4.2f", 7.1298 )` returns the string `"7.12"`.

* __Support for additional date and time arithmetics__: Subtracting two dates returns a day and time duration with the number of days between the two
  dates, ignoring daylight savings. For example,
+
[source,json]
.DateArithmetic.feel
----
date( "2017-05-12" ) - date( "2017-04-25" ) = duration( "P17D" )
----

[id="ref-dmn-model-enhancements"]
=== DMN model enhancements in {PRODUCT}

[role="_abstract"]
{PRODUCT} includes the following enhancements to DMN model support in the current DMN implementation:

* __Support for types with spaces on names__: The DMN XML schema defines type refs such as QNames. The QNames do not allow spaces. Therefore, it is not possible to use types like FEEL `date and time`,   `days and time duration` or `years and months duration`. This implementation does parse such typerefs as strings and allows type names with spaces. However, in order to comply with the XML schema, it also adds the following aliases to such types that can be used instead:

  ** `date and time` = `dateTime`
  ** `days and time duration` = `duration` or `dayTimeDuration`
  ** `years and months duration` = `duration` or `yearMonthDuration`
+
Note that, for the "duration" types, the user can simply use `duration` and the decision engine will infer the proper duration, either `days and time duration` or `years and months duration`.

* __Lists support heterogeneous element types__: Currently this implementation supports lists with heterogeneous element types. This is an experimental extension and does limit the functionality of some functions and filters. This decision will be re-evaluated in the future.

* __TypeRef link between Decision Tables and Item Definitions__: On decision tables/input clause, if no values list is defined, the decision engine automatically checks the type reference and applies the allowed values check if it is defined.

. For the selected DRD node, use the available connection options to create and connect to the next node in the DRD, or click and drag a new node onto the DRD canvas from the left toolbar.
+
--
The node type determines which connection options are supported. For example, an *Input data* node can connect to a decision node, knowledge source, or text annotation using the applicable connection type, whereas a *Knowledge source* node can connect to any DRD element. A *Decision* node can connect only to another decision or a text annotation.

The following connection types are available, depending on the node type:

* *Information requirement*: Use this connection from an input data node or decision node to another decision node that requires the information.
* *Knowledge requirement*: Use this connection from a business knowledge model to a decision node or to another business knowledge model that invokes the decision logic.
* *Authority requirement*: Use this connection from an input data node or a decision node to a dependent knowledge source or from a knowledge source to a decision node, business knowledge model, or another knowledge source.
* *Association*: Use this connection from an input data node, decision node, business knowledge model, or knowledge source to a text annotation.

In a DMN decision service node, the decision nodes in the bottom segment incorporate input data from outside of the decision service to arrive at a final decision in the top segment of the decision service node. The resulting top-level decisions from the decision service are then implemented in any subsequent decisions or business knowledge requirements of the DMN model. You can reuse DMN decision services in other DMN models to apply the same decision logic with different input data and different outgoing connections.

=== Defining DMN decision logic in boxed expressions in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler

[role="_abstract"]
Boxed expressions in DMN are tables that you use to define the underlying logic of decision nodes and business knowledge models in a decision requirements diagram (DRD). Some boxed expressions can contain other boxed expressions, but the top-level boxed expression corresponds to the decision logic of a single DRD artifact. While DRDs represent the flow of a DMN decision model, boxed expressions define the actual decision logic of individual nodes. DRDs and boxed expressions together form a complete and functional DMN decision model.

You can use the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler in VSCode to define decision logic for your DRD components using built-in boxed expressions.

.Procedure
. In your VSCode IDE, open the DMN file to view the decision requirements diagram (DRD) in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler.
+
--
include::../partials/vs-code-bundle-precondition.adoc[]
--
. In the DMN modeler canvas, select a decision node or business knowledge model node that you want to define and click the *Edit* icon to open the DMN boxed expression editor:
+
--
.Opening a new decision node boxed expression
image::dmn-decision-edit.png[]

.Opening a new business knowledge model boxed expression
image::dmn-bkm-edit.png[]

By default, all business knowledge models are defined as boxed function expressions containing a literal FEEL expression, a nested context expression of an external JAVA or PMML function, or a nested boxed expression of any type.

For decision nodes, you click the undefined table to select the type of boxed expression you want to use, such as a boxed literal expression, boxed context expression, decision table, or other DMN boxed expression.

.Selecting the logic type for a decision node
image::dmn-decision-boxed-expression-options.png[]

For business knowledge model nodes, you click the upper-left function cell to select the function type, or right-click the function value cell, select *Clear*, and select a boxed expression of another type.

.Selecting the function or other logic type for a business knowledge model
image::dmn-bkm-define.png[]
--
. For this example, use a decision node and select *Decision Table* as the boxed expression type.
+
A decision table in DMN is a visual representation of one or more rules in a tabular format. Each rule consists of a single row in the table, and includes columns that define the conditions (input) and outcome (output) for that particular row.
. Click the input column header to define the name and data type for the input condition. For example, name the input column *Credit Score.FICO* with a `number` data type. This column specifies numeric credit score values or ranges of loan applicants.
. Click the output column header to define the name and data type for the output values. For example, name the output column *Credit Score Rating* and next to the *Data Type* option, click *Manage* to go to the *Data Types* page where you can create a custom data type with score ratings as constraints.
+
.Managing data types for a column header value
image::dmn-manage-data-types.png[]

. On the *Data Types* page, click *New Data Type* to add a new data type.
+
--
For this example, click *New Data Type* and create a *Credit_Score_Rating* data type as a `string`:

.Adding a new data type
image::dmn-custom-data-type-add.png[]
--
. Click *Add Constraints*, select *Enumeration* from the drop-down options, and add the following constraints:
+
--
* `"Excellent"`
* `"Good"`
* `"Fair"`
* `"Poor"`
* `"Bad"`

.Adding constraints to the new data type
image::dmn-custom-data-type-constraints.png[]

For information about constraint types and syntax requirements for the specified data type, see the https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].
--

. Click *OK* to save the constraints and click the check mark to the right of the data type to save the data type.
. Return to the *Credit Score Rating* decision table, click the *Credit Score Rating* column header, and set the data type to this new custom data type.
. Use the *Credit Score.FICO* input column to define credit score values or ranges of values, and use the *Credit Score Rating* column to specify one of the corresponding ratings you defined in the *Credit_Score_Rating* data type.
+
Right-click any value cell to insert or delete rows (rules) or columns (clauses).
+
.Decision node decision table for credit score rating
image::dmn-decision-table-example1a.png[]

. After you define all rules, click the upper-left corner of the decision table to define the rule *Hit Policy* and *Builtin Aggregator* (for *COLLECT* hit policy only).
+
--
The hit policy determines how to reach an outcome when multiple rules in a decision table match the provided input values. The built-in aggregator determines how to aggregate rule values when you use the *COLLECT* hit policy.

.Defining the decision table hit policy
image::dmn-hit-policies.png[]

The following example is a more complex decision table that determines applicant qualification for a loan as the concluding decision node in the same loan prequalification decision model:

.Decision table for loan prequalification
image::dmn-decision-table-example3.png[]
--

For boxed expression types other than decision tables, you follow these guidelines similarly to navigate the boxed expression tables and define variables and parameters for decision logic, but according to the requirements of the boxed expression type. Some boxed expressions, such as boxed literal expressions, can be single-column tables, while other boxed expressions, such as function, context, and invocation expressions, can be multi-column tables with nested boxed expressions of other types.

For example, the following boxed context expression defines the parameters that determine whether a loan applicant can meet minimum mortgage payments based on principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI), represented as a front-end ratio calculation with a sub-context expression:

.Boxed context expression for front-end client PITI ratio
image::dmn-context-expression-example2.png[]

The following boxed function expression determines a monthly mortgage installment as a business knowledge model in a lending decision, with the function value defined as a nested context expression:

.Boxed function expression for installment calculation in business knowledge model
image::dmn-function-expression-example3.png[]

For more information and examples of each boxed expression type, see xref:con-dmn-boxed-expressions[].

=== Creating custom data types for DMN boxed expressions in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler

[role="_abstract"]
In DMN boxed expressions in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler, data types determine the structure of the data that you use within an associated table, column, or field in the boxed expression. You can use default DMN data types (such as String, Number, Boolean) or you can create custom data types to specify additional fields and constraints that you want to implement for the boxed expression values.

Custom data types that you create for a boxed expression can be simple or structured:

* *Simple* data types have only a name and a type assignment. Example: `Age (number)`.
* *Structured* data types contain multiple fields associated with a parent data type. Example: A single type `Person` containing the fields `Name (string)`, `Age (number)`, `Email (string)`.

// if we read the procedure, it repeats also steps for creating boxed expression, that is already demonstrated earlier
// - we could link creating/defining expression
// - we could link code snippets on gist/github to able users play with similar models quicker instead of creating them from scratch
.Procedure
. In your VSCode IDE, open the DMN file to view the decision requirements diagram (DRD) in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler.
+
--
include::../partials/vs-code-bundle-precondition.adoc[]
--
. In the DMN modeler canvas, select a decision node or business knowledge model for which you want to define the data types and click the *Edit* icon to open the DMN boxed expression editor.
. If the boxed expression is for a decision node that is not yet defined, click the undefined table to select the type of boxed expression you want to use, such as a boxed literal expression, boxed context expression, decision table, or other DMN boxed expression.
+
.Selecting the logic type for a decision node
image::dmn-decision-boxed-expression-options.png[]

. Click the cell for the table header, column header, or parameter field (depending on the boxed expression type) for which you want to define the data type and click *Manage* to go to the *Data Types* page where you can create a custom data type.
+
--
.Managing data types for a column header value
image::dmn-manage-data-types.png[]

You can also set and manage custom data types for a specified decision node or business knowledge model node by selecting the *Properties* icon in the upper-right corner of the DMN modeler:

.Managing data types in decision requirements diagram (DRD) properties
image::dmn-manage-data-types1a.png[]

The data type that you define for a specified cell in a boxed expression determines the structure of the data that you use within that associated table, column, or field in the boxed expression.

In this example, an output column *Credit Score Rating* for a DMN decision table defines a set of custom credit score ratings based on an applicant's credit score.
--
. On the *Data Types* page, click *New Data Type* to add a new data type.
+
--
For this example, click *New Data Type* and create a *Credit_Score_Rating* data type as a `string`:

.Adding a new data type
image::dmn-custom-data-type-add.png[]

If the data type requires a list of items, enable the *List* setting.
--
. Click *Add Constraints*, select *Enumeration* from the drop-down options, and add the following constraints:
+
--
* `"Excellent"`
* `"Good"`
* `"Fair"`
* `"Poor"`
* `"Bad"`

.Adding constraints to the new data type
image::dmn-custom-data-type-constraints.png[]

For information about constraint types and syntax requirements for the specified data type, see the https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN[Decision Model and Notation specification].
--

. Click *OK* to save the constraints and click the check mark to the right of the data type to save the data type.

. Return to the *Credit Score Rating* decision table, click the *Credit Score Rating* column header, set the data type to this new custom data type, and define the rule values for that column with the rating constraints that you specified.
+
--
.Decision table for credit score rating
image::dmn-decision-table-example1a.png[]

In the DMN decision model for this scenario, the *Credit Score Rating* decision flows into the following *Loan Prequalification* decision that also requires custom data types:

.Decision table for loan prequalification
image::dmn-manage-data-types-blank.png[]
--
. Continuing with this example, return to the *Data Types* window, click *New Data Type*, and create a *Loan_Qualification* data type as a `Structure` with no constraints.
+
--
When you save the new structured data type, the first sub-field appears so that you can begin defining nested data fields in this parent data type. You can use these sub-fields in association with the parent structured data type in boxed expressions, such as nested column headers in decision tables or nested table parameters in context or function expressions.

For additional sub-fields, select the addition icon next to the *Loan_Qualification* data type.

--
. For this example, under the structured *Loan_Qualification* data type, add a *Qualification* field with `"Qualified"` and `"Not Qualified"` enumeration constraints, and a *Reason* field with no constraints. Add also a simple *Back_End_Ratio* and a *Front_End_Ratio* data type, both with `"Sufficient"` and `"Insufficient"` enumeration constraints.
+
--
Click the check mark to the right of each data type that you create to save your changes.

.Adding nested data types with constraints
image::dmn-manage-data-types-structured2.png[]
--
. Return to the decision table and, for each column, click the column header cell, set the data type to the new corresponding custom data type, and define the rule values as needed for the column with the constraints that you specified, if applicable.
+

For boxed expression types other than decision tables, you follow these guidelines similarly to navigate the boxed expression tables and define custom data types as needed.

For example, the following boxed function expression uses custom `tCandidate` and `tProfile` structured data types to associate data for online dating compatibility:

[id="proc-dmn-model-creating-multiples"]
=== Creating DMN models with multiple diagrams in {VS_CODE_BUNDLE}

[role="_abstract"]
For complex DMN models, you can use the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler in VSCode to design multiple DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) that represent parts of the overall decision requirements graph (DRG) for the DMN decision model. In simple cases, you can use a single DRD to represent all of the overall DRG for the decision model, but in complex cases, a single DRD can become large and difficult to follow. Therefore, to better organize DMN decision models with many decision requirements, you can divide the model into smaller nested DRDs that constitute the larger central DRD representation of the overall DRG.

.Procedure
. In your VSCode IDE, create or import a DMN file in the relevant folder of your {PRODUCT} project, typically in `src/main/resources`.

. Open the new or imported DMN file to view the DRD in the {PRODUCT} DMN modeler, and begin designing or modifying the DRD using the DMN nodes in the left toolbar.
+
--
include::../partials/vs-code-bundle-precondition.adoc[]
--
. For any DMN nodes that you want to define in a separate nested DRD, select the node, click the *DRD Actions* icon, and select from the available options.
+
--
.DRD actions icon for subdividing a DRD
image::dmn-drd-actions.png[]

The following options are available:

* *Create*: Use this option to create a nested DRD where you can separately define the DMN components and diagram for the selected node.
* *Add to*: If you already created a nested DRD, use this option to add the selected node to an existing DRD.
* *Remove*: If the node that you selected is already within a nested DRD, use this option to remove the node from that nested DRD.

After you create a nested DRD within your DMN decision model, the new DRD opens in a separate DRD canvas and the available DRD and components are listed in the *Decision Navigator* right menu. You can use the *Decision Navigator* menu to rename or remove a nested DRD.

.Rename new nested DRD in the Decision Navigator menu
image::dmn-drd-actions-rename.png[]
--
. In the separate canvas for the new nested DRD, design the flow and logic for all required components in this portion of the DMN model, as usual.
. Continue adding and defining any other nested DRDs for your decision model and save the completed DMN file.
+
--
For example, the following DRD for a loan prequalification decision model contains all DMN components for the model without any nested DRDs. This example relies on the single DRD for all components and logic, resulting in a large and complex diagram.

.Single DRD for loan prequalification
image::dmn-example-drd.png[]

Alternatively, by following the steps in this procedure, you can divide this example DRD into multiple nested DRDs to better organize the decision requirements, as shown in the following example:
// the procedure bellow demonstrates spliting one DMN diagram into more DRDs, however we use a lot of screenshots , not much instructions.
// probably we could replace this with short text and link for complete dmn source file
