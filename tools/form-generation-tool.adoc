= Form Generation

include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

This is a functionality of the {VS_CODE_BUNDLE} and is used to generate web forms needed for the execution of processes.

Form Generation is included as a command in the BAMOE Developer Tools extension for VS Code (BAMOE VS Code extension). You can generate web forms for BAMOE and Apache Kie projects.

*Generation Prerequisities*

- Make sure that your project is compiled, otherwise the command will not be able to find all the form schemas.

You can generate forms by using the  existing https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie,window=_blank] *process-compact-architecture-example* project available at https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7151078[https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7151078].
You will find more example projects in this zip file, however *process-compact-architecture-example* requires the minimal effort to see forms in the action or you can use your own project.

Browsing the linked examples, you may notice the projects use Maven.
So when Maven builds an https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie,window=_blank] project, Kie generates JSON schemas to represent the data models for both Workflows and User Tasks.
The *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* then locates those JSON Schemas in the project and, taking advantage of the Uniforms APIs, processes them and generates static forms as a resource in the project `src/main/resources/forms` folder.


The `Custom Forms Dev` functionality is included as a command in the BAMOE Developer Tools extension for VS Code (BAMOE VS Code extension). To run a command in VS Code, open the command palette using the keyboard shortcut `CTRL + SHIFT + P` for Windows and Linux or `CMD + SHIFT + P for macOS`.

The `Custom Forms Dev` functionality is available in the `BAMOE Developer Tools: Generate form code for User Tasks` command. The command palette dynamically re-organizes based on user activity and input. For example, if you type 'BAMOE', it displays the available BAMOE Developer Tools commands.

image::tools/form-gen-generate-form-code.png[generate form code for user tasks]

When you select `BAMOE Developer Tools: Generate form code for User Tasks`, you must enter the absolute path of the BAMOE project. By default, this field is auto-filled with the currently opened workspace.

image::tools/form-gen-project-folder.png[select folder]

[NOTE]: 
----
As mentioned in 'Generation Prerequisites', the project must be compiled first; otherwise, the command will fail.
----

After entering the absolute path of BAMOE project, you must choose between `Bootstrap 4` and `PatternFly`, the two supported UI libraries. `Bootstrap 4` generates HTML code, while `PatternFly` generates React code.

image::tools/form-gen-libraries.png[libraries]

Next, you must choose whether to generate form code for all User Tasks or specific User Tasks.

image::tools/form-gen-user-tasks.png[user tasks]

If `Generate form code for specific User Tasks` is selected, an additional step appears, displaying a checkbox with a list of the project's User Tasks. The command  generates form code only for the selected tasks.

image::tools/form-gen-list-project-user-tasks.png[list of projects user tasks]

If the VS Code does not show any errors, the form code is generated in the project’s `src/main/resources/custom-forms-dev` folder.

image::tools/form-gen-code-project-folder.png[form code in folder]

If the selected forms already exist in the `custom-forms-dev` folder, an additional step prompts you to confirm whether to override the existing form files.

image::tools/form-gen-confirmation.png[confirmation]

The override process will erase the current form and config files, even if the type does not match.

For example:

If the user already has a `PatternFly` form for the 'hiring' User Task (a .tsx file) but chooses to generate a `Bootstrap 4` form (an .html file), overriding will erase `hiring.tsx` and `hiring.config`, replacing them with `\hiring.html` and a new `hiring.config` file.

[NOTE]: 
====
The form code generation process can be stopped at any time by pressing ESC.

//Once the *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* binary file is extracted and executable you can start the *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* from your command line.

//.Start the binary file - linux example
[source,bash]
----
./form-generation-cli-linux
----

This will start a wizard to help you generate the forms:

First, set the path to your https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache KIE,window=_blank] project.
This example will use *jbpm-compact-architecture-example*.

Kogito Form Generation CLI
===========================
 
This tool will help you generate forms for the Processes and User Tasks in your Kogito Projects.
The tool will search for the User Tasks JSON schemas generated in your project, so make sure the project is build.
The generated forms will be stored as resources in your project (in src/main/resources/forms folder).
 
? Type your Kogito Project path:---> /path/to/my/projects/jbpm-compact-architecture-example <---
----

Select one of the available Form types (Patternfly or Bootstrap 4).
Select Bootstrap 4.
Use the arrow keys to change the selection.

[source,bash]
----
? Select the Form type:
  patternfly
❯ bootstrap
----

Confirm Selection, type *Y*, to start the Form Generation process.

[source,bash]
----
Current selection:
Project path: /path/to/my/projects/jbpm-compact-architecture-example
Form type: bootstrap
 
? Do you want to continue? (Y/n) Y
----


[NOTE]
====
Currently there is an issue for the `Array` type.
You will probably spot similar warning between log messages.
This is a known and reported https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/1313[issue].

`Unsupported field type: Array`

=== Form Type
Form Generation function supports two form types:

* *patternfly*: This type generates *.tsx* files using the *patternfly* library for styling the forms.
* *bootstrap4*: This type generates *.html* files using the *bootstrap4* library for styling the forms.

Furthermore, according to the file name extension, we can say that *.tsx* files are **React** forms and *.html* files are *plain html* forms.

=== Form Config
Each generated form, both *patternfly* and *bootstrap4*, has a corresponding *.config* file.
Such config files contain schema information about the object that the form is generated for.
Furthermore, the goal of this *.config* file is to load additional scripts and styles.

For the *patternfly* forms, by default, no additional scripts or styles are loaded.

For the *bootstrap4* forms, by default, we load `bootstrap@4.0.0` styles and `jquery@3.2.1` scripts.

== Form DevUI
For Quarkus-based https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie, window=_blank] projects, you can use and test them by using the *jBPM Quarkus DevUI* extension.

To do so, just add the following dependency in your project `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jbpm</groupId>
    <artifactId>jbpm-quarkus-devui</artifactId>
    <version>9.1.x-ibm-0001</version>
</dependency>
----
Where 'x' is the product version.
NOTE: This is already done for *jbpm-compact-architecture-example*.

And start the project in Dev mode with the command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean -Pdevelopment quarkus:dev
----

Then, in your browser, navigate to:
[source,bash]
----
http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui/extensions
----

[NOTE]
====
//TOD Add Link for the issue
Currently *jbpm-compact-architecture-example* contains one wrong dependency that needs to be removed.
Please remove `org.jbpm:jbpm-quarkus-devui-bom` from the project `pom.xml`.
For more information, see xref:../introduction/release-notes/known-limitations.adoc[Known limitations].
====

On the displayed page, find this card and click *Forms*.

.jBPM Quarkus Dev UI Card

Now you should see a list of all available forms that we listed via the command line earlier in this documentation.

.Forms list
image::tools/forms.png[Forms list]

Choosing a form will present the option to adjust it.
Continue with the *hiring* form.
Click on it to open it.
Now you see two tabs: *Source* and *Connections*.


=== Source
The *Source* tab displays the form source code on the left side, while on the right side there is the form UI.

.Hiring form
image::tools/hiring.png[Hiring form]

Let's remove this piece of the source code
[source,html]
----
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <h4 class="alert-heading">Unsupported field type: Array</h4>
  <p>Cannot find form control for property <code>candidateData.skills</code> with type <code>Array</code>.</p>
  <hr />
  <p class="mb-0">
    Some complex property types, such as <code>Array</code> aren't yet supported, however, you can still write your own component into
    the form and manually bind it.
  </p>
</div>
----

and click the *Execute form* button.
You will immediately see the result.

.Updated hiring form
image::tools/hiring-updated.png[Updated hiring form]

The same functionality is available for the `React` forms.

=== Connections
The *Connections* tab displays loaded scripts and styles.

IMPORTANT: This tab is for loading external resources only.

You can to load newer `bootstrap@5.1.3` version.

To do it, update the `hiring.config` from:

[source,json]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "jquery.js": "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js",
    "bootstrap.bundle.min.js": "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
  },
  "styles": {
    "bootstrap.min.css": "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  }
}
----

to:

[source,json]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "jquery.js": "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js",
    "bootstrap.bundle.min.js": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
  },
  "styles": {
    "bootstrap.min.css": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  }
}
----

After updating `hiring.config` to use `bootstrap@5.1.3` instead of `bootstrap@4.0.0`, the form UI should be more compact, using smaller visual gaps between elements.
