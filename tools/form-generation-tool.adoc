= Form Generation tool

include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

The *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* generates web forms needed for Workflows execution.

Before you start using the *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}*, please be sure you properly understand xref:../tools/authoring-workflows.adoc[Workflows,window=_blank], formerly known as Business Processes.

== Tool Installation
// TODO: what url to use?
Please download *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* zip file available at https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7151078[https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7151078].
The zip file contains three binary files of the same tool for multiple operating systems.
Please choose the binary file according your operating system and extract it into desired destination.
Then please make sure the binary file is executable.

.Make sure the binary file is executable - linux example
[source,bash]
----
chmod a+x form-generation-cli-linux

== Form Generation

You can generate forms using the *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* for any Workflow that requires input data.
However, for this documentation, we will use existing https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie,window=_blank] *jbpm-compact-architecture-example* project available at https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7151078[https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7151078].
You will find more example projects in this zip file, however *jbpm-compact-architecture-example* requires the minimal effort to see forms in the action.
Or you can use your own project.


Browsing the linked examples, you may notice the projects use Maven.
So when Maven builds an https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie,window=_blank] project, Kie generates JSON schemas to represent the data models for both Workflows and User Tasks.
The *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* then locates those JSON Schemas in the project and, taking advantage of the Uniforms APIs, processes them and generates static forms as a resource in the project `src/main/resources/forms` folder.

*Generation Prerequisities*

- Make sure your https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie,window=_blank] project has been compiled, otherwise the CLI won't be able to find all the form schemas.

Once the *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* binary file is extracted and executable you can start the *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* from your command line.

.Start the binary file - linux example
[source,bash]
----
./form-generation-cli-linux
----

This will start a wizard to help you generate the forms:

First, set the path to your https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie,window=_blank] project.
We will use *jbpm-compact-architecture-example*.

[source,bash]
----
Kogito Form Generation CLI
===========================
 
This tool will help you generate forms for the Processes and User Tasks in your Kogito Projects.
The tool will search for the User Tasks JSON schemas generated in your project, so make sure the project is build.
The generated forms will be stored as resources in your project (in src/main/resources/forms folder).
 
? Type your Kogito Project path:---> /path/to/my/projects/jbpm-compact-architecture-example <---
----

Select one of the available Form types (Patternfly or Bootstrap 4).
We will use Bootstrap 4.
Use the arrow keys to change the selection.

[source,bash]
----
? Select the Form type:
  patternfly
❯ bootstrap
----

Confirm Selection, type *Y*, to start the Form Generation process.

[source,bash]
----
Current selection:
Project path: /path/to/my/projects/jbpm-compact-architecture-example
Form type: bootstrap
 
? Do you want to continue? (Y/n) Y
----


[NOTE]
====
Currently there is an issue for the `Array` type.
You will probably spot similar warning between log messages.
This is a known and reported https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/1313[issue].

`Unsupported field type: Array`
====


Once the generation is done, browse to `/path/to/my/projects/jbpm-compact-architecture-example/src/main/resources/forms` folder.

[source,bash]
----
ls /path/to/my/projects/jbpm-compact-architecture-example/src/main/resources/forms/

=== Form Type
*{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* supports two form types:

* *patternfly*: This type generates *.tsx* files using the *patternfly* library for styling the forms.
* *bootstrap*: This type generates *.html* files using the *bootstrap* library for styling the forms.

Furthermore, according to the file name extension, we can say that *.tsx* files are **React** forms and *.html* files are *plain html* forms.

=== Form Config
Each generated form, both *patternfly* and *bootstrap*, has a corresponding *.config* file.
Such config files contain schema information about the object that the form is generated for.
Furthermore, the goal of this *.config* file is to load additional scripts and styles.

For the *patternfly* forms, by default, no additional scripts or styles are loaded.

For the *bootstrap* forms, by default, we load `bootstrap@4.0.0` styles and `jquery@3.2.1` scripts.

== Form DevUI
For Quarkus-based https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie, window=_blank] projects, you can use and test them by using the *jBPM Quarkus DevUI* extension.

To do so, just add the following dependency in your project `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jbpm</groupId>
    <artifactId>jbpm-quarkus-devui</artifactId>
    <version>9.1.0-ibm-0001</version>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: This is already done for *jbpm-compact-architecture-example*.

And start the project in Dev mode with the command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean -Pdevelopment quarkus:dev
----

Then, in your browser, navigate to:
[source,bash]
----
http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui/extensions
----

[NOTE]
====
//TOD Add Link for the issue
Currently *jbpm-compact-architecture-example* contains one wrong dependency that needs to be removed.
Please remove `org.jbpm:jbpm-quarkus-devui-bom` from the project `pom.xml`.
For more information, see xref:../introduction/release-notes/known-limitations.adoc[Known limitations].
====

On the displayed page, find this card and click *Forms*.

.jBPM Quarkus Dev UI Card
image::tools/jbpm-runtime-tools-quarkus-dev-ui.png[jBPM Quarkus Dev UI Card]


Now we should see a list of all available forms that we listed via the command line earlier in this documentation.

.Forms list
image::tools/forms.png[Forms list]

Then, if we choose any form, we will have an option to adjust it. 
We will continue with the *hiring* form.
Please click on it to open it.
Now we see two tabs: *Source* and *Connections*.


=== Source
The *Source* tab displays the form source code on the left side, while on the right side there is the form UI.

.Hiring form
image::tools/hiring.png[Hiring form]

Let's remove this piece of the source code
[source,html]
----
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <h4 class="alert-heading">Unsupported field type: Array</h4>
  <p>Cannot find form control for property <code>candidateData.skills</code> with type <code>Array</code>.</p>
  <hr />
  <p class="mb-0">
    Some complex property types, such as <code>Array</code> aren't yet supported, however, you can still write your own component into
    the form and manually bind it.
  </p>
</div>
----

and click the *Execute form* button. We will immediately see the result.

.Updated hiring form
image::tools/hiring-updated.png[Updated hiring form]

The same functionality is available for the `React` forms.

=== Connections
The *Connections* tab displays loaded scripts and styles.

IMPORTANT: This tab is for loading external resources only.

We can try to load newer `bootstrap@5.1.3` version.

To do it, we need to update the `hiring.config` from:

[source,json]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "jquery.js": "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js",
    "bootstrap.bundle.min.js": "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
  },
  "styles": {
    "bootstrap.min.css": "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  }
}
----

to:

[source,json]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "jquery.js": "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js",
    "bootstrap.bundle.min.js": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
  },
  "styles": {
    "bootstrap.min.css": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  }
}
----

After updating `hiring.config` to use `bootstrap@5.1.3` instead of `bootstrap@4.0.0`, the form UI should be more compact, using smaller visual gaps between elements.
