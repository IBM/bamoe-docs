== Importing DMN Data Types from Java classes
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

{DEV_TOOLS} allows you to create DMN Data Types directly from Java POJOs. This step-by-step guide aims to describe how effectively using it.

NOTE: This feature is currently available in the DMN Editor (classic) only.

=== Prerequisites
* {DEV_TOOLS} @ {VERSION}
* VS Code (1.66.0+)
* Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat (1.31+) VS Code extension
* Your domainâ€™s Java Classes;
* The Activator, a Java class file (Activator.java) required to activate the functionality;

=== Project Setup
Any {PRODUCT_SHORT} project that holds DMN assets is a perfect pick can be used as a reference. This guide will refer to an existing project that lives in the xref:../getting-started/examples.html[kie-kogito-examples], which already contains DMN assets. The steps to follow are:

1. Clone the `incubator-kie-kogito-examples` repository.
2. Open VS Code and navigate to `incubator-kie-kogito-examples/kogito-quarkus-examples/dmn-quarkus-example`.
3. Add the Java Classes you need to convert to DMN Data Type in any package under the `src/main/java` directory of your {PRODUCT_SHORT} project.
4. In the same package defined in the previous point, create the  `Activator` Java Class. The Activator class **must** be an empty Java Class exactly named "Activator.java". Any change or additional code can affect negatively the feature behavior.

=== Importing your Java Classes as DMN Types

Open your target DMN file, the reference for this guide is the `TrafficViolation.dmn` file already available in the example project. Go to the `Data Types` tab. Here, you should notice a  button: `Import Java Classes`.
Be aware that this button is enabled only if the previously described requirements are satisfied.

After clicking that button, the Import Java Classes panel will appear. At this point, follow these steps:

* **Select Java Classes:** In the search box, put the name of the Java Class you want to import as a DMN Type. You can use the class simple name (eg. Book) or the full qualified name (eg. dto.Book). Below the search box, a list with all Java Classes that match the provided key will appear. Select the ones you want to import. When ready, click on the `Next` button.
