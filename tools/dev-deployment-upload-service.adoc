= BAMOE Canvas Dev Deployment Upload Service
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]
include::../styles/images.adoc[]

The Dev Deployment Upload Service runs an HTTP server that accepts ZIP file uploads to the `/upload` endpoint. 
Verify that the service is ready to accept uploads via the `/upload-status` endpoint.

When an upload is complete, the application unzips the file at the configured location and exits with a 0 code. 
If anything goes wrong during execution, it exits with code 1, and a helpful message is printed to stderr.

To install it, download the zip file, extract it, and copy the correct executable somewhere in the `PATH` (usually `/usr/local/bin`).

USAGE: `dev-deployment-upload-service`.
