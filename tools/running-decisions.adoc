= Running Decisions
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]
 
Developing a Decision can be very complex, depending on the number of rules you have on Decision Tables and the possibilities you have available with the many values that compose its inputs.
{CANVAS} allows you to run your Decisions while developing them, making it easy for you to test scenarios and reproduce them after you make changes.
It's also very useful for quickly evaluating a set of inputs.
We call this capability of running Decisions while developing them “DMN Runner”.

When you open the Editor page for Decisions, you have an extra “Run” button available at the top-right, as you see in the figure below.
Clicking this button will open the DMN Runner panel, in either Form or Table mode.
You can easily switch between the modes by clicking the Table icon in the first column of the Form mode and by clicking the Form icon in the Table rows individually.

Let's create a new Decision from one of the Samples provided by {CANVAS}.
On the Home screen, select “Try sample” on the Decision card.
When you click the “Run” button, you'll see the screen below.
Let's see what those elements are.

. *Run button* → Lets you show/hide DMN Runner panels.
  Clicking the arrow lets you select the mode you want -- Table or Form.
  It's also possible to download, load, or delete inputs.
  Deleting inputs is a permanent operation and cannot be undone.
. *Add input row button* → Clicking this button will create a new set of inputs.
  In Form mode, you can only see one “row” at a time.
  To see all your input rows at the same time, switch to Table mode.
. *Table mode button* → Switches DMN Runner to Table mode.

Let's add a new input row, switch to Table mode, and look at the DMN Runner elements.

. *Show row in Form mode button* → Switches DMN Runner to Form mode and displays the selected row.
. *“Run” tab* → Lets you quickly show/hide the DMN Runner Table.
  Clicking this button is the same as clicking the “Run” button at the top right.

DMN Runner remembers the mode you used for each file, so if you use the File switcher to move between files, you can see DMN Runner switching modes, depending on the last mode you used for each file.

Now that you're familiar with the DMN Runner controls, running your Decision with your input rows is easy.
Just fill in the input fields and see the results live in the Outputs column in Form mode, or the right-hand-side Table in Table mode.

If you're familiar with the DMN Boxed Expression Editor, you'll be very comfortable navigating through the DMN Runner Table, as they share the same Table component.

DMN Runner will infer the type of your inputs from their Data Types.
We encourage you to keep your Data Types organized for better maintainability of your Decision, and to extract the most of what DMN Runner has to offer.

Loading an input file with unmatching input names and/or Data Types will ignore the unmatching inputs.

== Limitations

* Recursive Struct Data Types are not yet supported.
  You'll see a placeholder component where the inputs should be if you have one of those in your Decision.
* Your input data is not versioned as part of your repository, and it is only persisted in your browser.
  They are saved to your disk, so you can safely close your tabs and restart your computer.
  If you want to share a set of inputs, use the “Download inputs” and the “Load inputs” buttons in the “Run” drop-down.
* Undo/redo operations are not yet supported on the DMN Runner.
* Changing a Data Type can potentially erase all the values you have for an input.
* Renaming an input will delete the input values previously saved.
