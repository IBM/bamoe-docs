Decision authoring on {CANVAS} happens inside the Editor page for Decisions, where you can edit, validate, run, and deploy DMN files.

Let's start by describing the elements present on the DMN Editor.

. *DMN Editor tabs →* Here you can switch between the four screens that compose the DMN Editor.
[loweralpha]
.. Editor → Will display your DRG and DRDs you select.
   This is where you edit your DMN model and create relationships between its nodes.
.. Documentation → Will display a downloadable PDF containing the specification of your Decision.
.. Data Types → Lets you manage the Data Types that are part of your Decision.
.. Included Models → Lets you manage other Decisions you linked to your current Decision.
   Including a Decision lets you reuse nodes and Data Types from it.
. *Search button →* Lets you search specific elements of your Decision.
. *Side panel strip* → Lets you select which side panel you want to toggle.
  From top to bottom, those are the available panels:
[loweralpha]
.. Navigator → Displays all the elements of your Decision organized by DRG and DRDs, and types.
.. Properties → Lets you manage the properties of a Decision element.
.. Preview → Displays a minimap of your DRG.
. *Node palette →* From here you can select nodes and drag them into your DRG or DRDs..
. *Keyboard shortcuts panel toggle →* Clicking here toggles a panel with information of keyboard shortcuts available on the DMN Editor.

The DMN Editor lets you develop Decisions and Business Knowledge Models (BKMs) using the DMN Boxed Expression Editor.
Drag a new Decision or BKM node to the DRG and let's open it with the DMN Boxed Expression Editor.

Selecting Edit on a new Decision will bring you to an empty Boxed Expression.
On a new BKM you have an empty Boxed Function.
The implementation of this Boxed Function can be of any type.

Selecting a Boxed Expression type will update the implementation of the Decision or BKM.

Here's an example Decision Table.

And a BKM with a Literal implementation.

The Boxed Expression Editor is very capable, and can handle complex implementations.
It's built based on the same Table component {CANVAS} uses on DMN Runner, so you will feel at home in both places.

Developing Decisions through DMN files is a complex subject and has many intricacies that are out of the scope of this document.
Refer to DMN-specific material, like the https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.3/PDF[DMN specification] itself.
