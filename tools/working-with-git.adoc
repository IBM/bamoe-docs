{CANVAS} streamlines the usage of Git in order to simplify workflows and walk you through a contribution model that minimizes conflicts and spares you from the complexity of managing a Git repository.

All Git repositories in {CANVAS} are stored in-browser, and can be synced with a remote Git repository by using a simplified set of operations, steering clear from complex choices you have to deal with when using Git from the Command Line.

{CANVAS} auto-saves all changes you make and persists it to the disk.
You can safely close your browser tabs and turn off your computer.
Your work will be there when you come back.
We recommend that you Push your work after you're done for the development session, as should something happen to your computer, your changes will be safely stored with your Git provider.

Each card that appears on the Home page is a separate Git repository, and can contain any amount of files, nested directories, and file types.
{CANVAS} can handle large repositories, with our internal tests being capable of handling 10,000 files.
Although supported, we do not encourage users to create such large repositories, as {CANVAS} is optimized for working with micro-services that are deployed to a Cloud environment.

=== Branches

You can select which branch you want to work with when importing a remote Git repository.
For projects that were created directly on {CANVAS}, the default `main` branch is used.
Changing branches of Git repositories on {CANVAS} is not possible.
If you want to work on two separate branches at the same time, you can use import your repository again selecting a different branch.

=== Conflict resolution

Although rare if you're working on a feature branch, conflicts still can happen if you made changes externally or if you're sharing a branch with a peer.

When you Sync your repository on {CANVAS}, if there's a conflict, you'll see an alert similar to this one:

.Conflict error dialog

{CANVAS} does not provide a way for you to resolve conflicts, instead, it lets you switch to a new branch temporarily, ignore the conflict and continue working.

If you want, you can solve your conflicts externally using your preferred method and tool, Push, go back to {CANVAS} and Pull.
You can pick up right where you left off.
