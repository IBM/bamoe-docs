= BAMOE Developer Tools for VS Code
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

{PRODUCT_SHORT} provides a useful VS Code Extension that bundles graphical Editors for BPMN, DMN, and SCESIM files.
The {DEV_TOOLS} extension can be downloaded from the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.bamoe-developer-tools[VS Code Marketplace].

Static file validation, DMN Runner, and Dev Deployments are not available for {DEV_TOOLS}, however it is possible to get a similar experience of DMN Runner with the Test Scenario Editor.
For more information see below.

== DMN Editor
In {DEV_TOOLS} you can consume DMN files in the following ways:

* **New DMN Editor**:
+
image::developer-tools/dmn-editor-new.gif[]
+
Since {PRODUCT_SHORT} {VERSION_911} a new DMN Editor is available. That is implemented with a modern technologies stack and with native support of DMN 1.5 specifications. This new editor can open 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 DMN file versions, and it automatically saves them to DMN 1.5. If you are upgrading from a previous {PRODUCT_SHORT} version (e.g. {VERSION_90X} or {VERSION_80X}), your DMN files will be automatically converted to DMN 1.5 version without any loss of logic.

* **DMN Editor (classic)**:
+

+
This is the classic version of the DMN Editor inherited from {PRODUCT_SHORT} {VERSION_80X}. This editor can open 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 DMN file versions only, and it saves them to version 1.2.
+
NOTE: The DMN Editor (classic) should be considered a deprecated tool. That means, no new feature will land in this editor version and it will be eventually removed in a future {PRODUCT_SHORT} version.

The new Editor is currently set as the default choice for DMN assets. The steps to switch to the DMN Editor (classic) are:

image::developer-tools/dmn-editor-switch-version.png[]

. Right-click on the currently opened DMN file tab
. Select `Reopen Editor with...`
. Select `BAMOE DMN/Test Scenario Editors (classic)`
. In the same menu, it's possible selecting `Configure default editor for '*.dmn'...` to change the default editor in your local machine

=== Test Scenario Editor
Test scenarios in {PRODUCT_SHORT} enable you to validate the functionality of business rules (for rules-based test scenarios) or of DMN models (for DMN-based test scenarios) before deploying them into a production environment.
With a test scenario, you use data from your project to set given conditions and expected results based on one or more defined business rules. When you run the scenario, the expected results and actual results of the rule instance are compared.
If the expected results match the actual results, the test is successful. If the expected results do not match the actual results, then the test fails.

NOTE: The current version of the Test Scenario Editor doesn't support the rules-based test scenarios yet.

In {DEV_TOOLS} you can author scesim files in the following ways:

* **New Test Scenario Editor**:
+
image::developer-tools/scesim-editor-new.png[]
+
Since {PRODUCT_SHORT} {VERSION_920} a new Test Scenario Editor is available. If you are upgrading from a previous {PRODUCT_SHORT} version (e.g. {VERSION_900} or {VERSION_80}), your *.scesim files will be compatible with the new Editor.


* **Classic Test Scenario Editor**:
+
This is the classic version of the Test Scenario Editor inherited from {PRODUCT_SHORT} {VERSION_80}.
+
NOTE: The Classic Test Scenario Editor should be considered a deprecated tool. That means, no new feature will land in this editor version and it will be eventually removed in a future {PRODUCT_SHORT} version. This editor parses DMN assets generated with the Classic Editor only (DMN version 1.2).

The new Editor is currently set as the default choice for scesim assets. The steps to switch to the classic Editor are:

image::developer-tools/scesim-editor-switch-version.png[]

. Right-click on the currently opened scesim file tab
. Select `Reopen Editor with...`
. Select `BAMOE DMN/Test Scenario Editors (classic)`
. In the same menu, it's possible selecting `Configure default editor for '*.scesim'...` to change the default editor in your local machine

The scesim files produced by the new Test Scenario Editor can be consumed by the Classic Test Scenario Editor.
