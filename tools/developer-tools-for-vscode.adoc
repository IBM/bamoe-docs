= Developer Tools for VS Code
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

{PRODUCT_SHORT} provides a useful VS Code Extension that bundles graphical Editors for BPMN, DMN files, and SCESIM files.
The {DEV_TOOLS} extension can be downloaded from the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.bamoe-developer-tools[VS Code Marketplace].

The bundled BPMN, DMN and Test Scenario Editors are made available through the KIE DMN Editor and KIE BPMN Editor extensions, and they include the same features that are available on {CANVAS}.
Static file validation, DMN Runner, and Dev Deployments are not available for {DEV_TOOLS}, however it is possible to get a similar experience of DMN Runner with the Test Scenario Editor.
For more information see below.

== DMN Editor
In {DEV_TOOLS} you can consume DMN files in the following ways:

* **New DMN Editor**:
+
image::developer-tools/dmn-editor-new.gif[]
+
Since {PRODUCT_SHORT} {VERSION_910} a new DMN Editor is available. That is implemented with a modern technologies stack and with native support of DMN 1.5 specifications. This new editor can open 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 DMN file versions, and it automatically saves them to DMN 1.5. If you are upgrading from a previous {PRODUCT_SHORT} version (e.g. {VERSION_900} or {VERSION_80}), your DMN files will be automatically converted to DMN 1.5 version without any loss of logic.

* **Classic DMN Editor**:
+
image::developer-tools/dmn-editor-classic.gif[]
+
This is the classic version of the DMN Editor inherited from {PRODUCT_SHORT} {VERSION_80}. This editor can open 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 DMN file versions only, and it saves them to version 1.2.
+
NOTE: The Classic DMN Editor should be considered a deprecated tool. That means, no new feature will land in this editor version and it will be eventually removed in a future {PRODUCT_SHORT} version.

The new Editor is currently set as the default choice for DMN assets. The steps to switch to the classic Editor are:

. Right-click on the currently opened DMN file tab
. Select `Reopen Editor with...`
. Select `BAMOE DMN Editor (classic)`
. In the same menu, it's possible selecting `Configure default editor for '*.dmn'...` to change the default editor in your local machine

== Importing DMN Data Types from Java classes

{DEV_TOOLS} allows you to create DMN Data Types directly from Java POJOs. This step-by-step guide aims to describe how effectively using it.

NOTE: This feature is currently available in the Classic DMN Editor only.

=== Prerequisites
* {DEV_TOOLS} {VERSION_910}
* VSCode (1.66.0+)
* Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat (1.31+) VSCode extension
* Your domainâ€™s Java Classes;
* The Activator, a Java class file (Activator.java) required to activate the functionality;

=== Project Setup
Any {PRODUCT_SHORT} project that holds DMN assets is a perfect pick can be used as a reference. This guide will refer to an existing project that lives in the xref:../getting-started/examples.html[kie-kogito-examples], which already contains DMN assets. The steps to follow are:

1. Clone the `incubator-kie-kogito-examples` repository.
2. Open VSCode and navigate to `incubator-kie-kogito-examples/kogito-quarkus-examples/dmn-quarkus-example`.
3. Add the Java Classes you need to convert to DMN Data Type in any package under the `src/main/java` directory of your {PRODUCT_SHORT} project.
4. In the same package defined in the previous point, create the  `Activator` Java Class. The Activator class **must** be an empty Java Class exactly named "Activator.java". Any change or additional code can affect negatively the feature behavior.

=== Importing your Java Classes as DMN Types

Open your target DMN file, the reference for this guide is the `TrafficViolation.dmn` file already available in the example project. Go to the `Data Types` tab. Here, you should notice a  button: `Import Java Classes`.
Be aware that this button is enabled only if the previously described requirements are satisfied.

image::developer-tools/dmn-import-java-classes-button.png[]

After clicking that button, the Import Java Classes panel will appear. At this point, follow these steps:

* **Select Java Classes:** In the search box, put the name of the Java Class you want to import as a DMN Type. You can use the class simple name (eg. Book) or the full qualified name (eg. dto.Book). Below the search box, a list with all Java Classes that match the provided key will appear. Select the ones you want to import. When ready, click on the `Next` button.
+

+
* **Select Fields and Review:** In this section, the list of all Java Classes' fields will be shown.
+
image::developer-tools/dmn-import-java-classes-fields.png[]
+
* **Import:** Press the `Import` button. This will automatically import the selected Java Class in the DMN Data Type tab.

== Running unit tests with Test Scenario

=== Setup and creation of Test Scenarios

Refer to xref:../editing/authoring-scesim.html[Authoring Test Scenario] for setup and scenario creation.

=== Executing the Test Scenario
1. **Save the File**:
   Save the `.scesim` file (`CTRL+S`).
2. **Run Tests**:
   Open a terminal in your project's root directory (eg. the `incubator-kie-kogito-examples/kogito-quarkus-examples/dmn-pmml-quarkus-example`) and execute:
+
[source,console]
----
   $ mvn clean test
----
+

Alternatively, if you installed the `Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat` extension, run the test from `KogitoScenarioJunitActivator.java` using the `Run Java` button in VSCode.
3. **Verify Results**:
   Check the results to ensure the scenarios pass. The test results will be visible in your Terminal after the completion of the `mvn clean test` command.
+

+
Using the `Run Java` button provided by `Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat`, the test results will appear in the native VSCode `Test Results` window.
