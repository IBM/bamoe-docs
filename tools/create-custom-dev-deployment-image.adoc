= Creating a custom Dev Deployment image
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

For convenience, one of the deployment options in {CANVAS} allows the user to input a custom image and a custom command to start the application once the upload is complete.

{CANVAS} expects a few things from a custom image to guarantee it can upload the project assets and manage the deployment on the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster.

== Requirements:

1. Have the xref:dev-deployment-upload-service.html[Dev Deployment Upload Service] binary installed and available globally, as {CANVAS} will override the default command from your image with `dev-deployment-upload-service && <CUSTOM_COMMAND>` (`<CUSTOM_COMMAND>` is defined in the UI when deploying the image);
2. The image must expose port `8080`, and all services running on the container should listen to this port. This includes the `dev-deployment-upload-service`, which can be configured by setting the `DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_PORT` environment variable to `8080`;
3. After {CANVAS} uploads the assets to the `dev-deployment-upload-service` listening inside your image, and the service finishes unzipping and placing the files in the configured directory, it's expected that an application will start and provide an endpoint `/q/health` that responds with **`HTTP 200`** so that {CANVAS} can acknowledge that the application started successfully and is running;

== Example 1: Using the Canvas Dev Deployment Base image

Let's use the `quay.io/bamoe/canvas-dev-deployment-base:{IMAGE_VERSION_910}` image as a base since it already has the `dev-deployment-upload-service` pre-configured.

=== Containerfile

[source,docker,subs="+attributes"]
----
# Set the base image with Java 17, Maven, and the dev-deployment-upload-service.
FROM quay.io/bamoe/canvas-dev-deployment-base:{IMAGE_VERSION_910}

# Start as root to get elevated access.
USER root

# Configure the dev-deployment-upload-service:
# Our extraction directory is /src/main/resources inside our Quarkus app, but it may differ for your application.
# This is the path where all files from your {CANVAS} project (including .dmn, .bpmn, etc) will be extracted to after upload.
ENV DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_EXTRACT_TO_DIR=$HOME_PATH/app/src/main/resources
ENV DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_PORT=8080

# Copy your Quarkus app folder with everything needed to run a Quarkus app with .dmn and .bpmn resources,
# setting the permissions/ownership for the target user.
COPY --chown=$USER_ID:$USER_ID ./my-quarkus-app $HOME_PATH/app/

# Expose port 8080
EXPOSE 8080

# Set to a user different than root (in this case, user ID 185, coming from our base image).
USER $USER_ID

# Set the entrypoint to run bash.
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

# The CMD directive is unnecessary since {CANVAS} will overwrite it.
----

== Example 2: Using an OpenJDK base image

Using the `icr.io/appcafe/ibm-semeru-runtimes:open-17-jdk-ubi-minimal` image as a base, let's create a Dev Deployment image that follows all the requirements listed above and results in a Quarkus app running with the project files uploaded by {CANVAS}.

=== Containerfile

[source,docker,subs="+attributes"]
----
# Set the base image with Java 17 and Maven.
FROM icr.io/appcafe/ibm-semeru-runtimes:open-17-jdk-ubi-minimal

# Arguments and environment variables to define our user and home path.
# Obs.: This can vary according to your base image.
ARG USER_ID_ARG=185
ARG HOME_PATH_ARG=$HOME
ENV USER_ID=${USER_ID_ARG}
ENV HOME_PATH=${HOME_PATH_ARG}

# Start as root to install all required dependencies.
USER root

# Configure the dev-deployment-upload-service:
# Our extraction directory is /src/main/resources inside our Quarkus app, but it may differ for your application.
# This is the path where all files from your {CANVAS} project (including .dmn, .bpmn, etc) will be extracted to after upload.
ENV DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_EXTRACT_TO_DIR=$HOME_PATH/app/src/main/resources
ENV DEV_DEPLOYMENT__UPLOAD_SERVICE_PORT=8080

# Install `tar` and `gzip` packages, as they are required by the dev-deployment-upload-service to unzip the uploaded files.
RUN microdnf --disableplugin=subscription-manager install -y tar gzip \
 && microdnf --disableplugin=subscription-manager clean all

# Create the user home, tmp, and .m2 paths to be used by our application.
# Setting the permission to 777 is important so users can access and modify these files during runtime.
RUN mkdir -p -m 777 $HOME_PATH/app \
 && mkdir -p -m 777 /tmp/app \
 && mkdir -p -m 777 /.m2

# Copy the dev-deployment-upload-service binary to the /usr/local/bin directory, making it globally available.
# NOTE: In this base image /usr/local/bin is included in the PATH environment variable,
# if you're using a different one, make sure the binary is globally accessible.
COPY dev-deployment-upload-service /usr/local/bin

# Another round of changing permissions and ownership of directories.
# This is important because our Quarkus app will make changes to files during runtime.
RUN chgrp -R 0 $HOME_PATH/app && \
 chmod -R 777 $HOME_PATH/app && \
 chgrp -R 0 /.m2 && \
 chmod -R 777 /.m2

# Change the work directory to our app path.
WORKDIR $HOME_PATH/app/

# Copy your Quarkus app folder with everything needed to run a Quarkus app with .dmn and .bpmn resources,
# setting the permissions/ownership for the target user.
COPY --chown=$USER_ID:$USER_ID ./my-quarkus-app $HOME_PATH/app/

# Expose port 8080
EXPOSE 8080

# Set to a user different than root (in this case, user ID 185, but it may vary depending on your base image).
USER $USER_ID

# Set the entrypoint to run bash.
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

# The CMD directive is unnecessary since {CANVAS} will overwrite it.
----

All that is needed to do is build and publish the image.

== Using your custom image on {CANVAS}

For the following steps, let's assume you tagged and pushed your image to `quay.io/myUserName/myDevDeploymentImage:latest`.

When creating a Dev Deployment on {CANVAS} you'll be met with this modal:

.Deploy modal
image::tools/devDeployments/deployment-option-kogito-quarkus-blank-app.png[]

By default, it uses the pre-configured `Kogito Quarkus Blank App` option, but we want to use our custom image, so we need to open the dropdown and select `Custom Image`.

.Custom Image deployment option
image::tools/devDeployments/deployment-option-custom-image.png[]

Notice the `Docker Image` parameter; it must be changed to the custom image tag created (`quay.io/myUserName/myDevDeploymentImage:latest` in this example).

Also, notice the `Command` parameter; it will execute `./mvnw quarkus:dev` inside the `$HOME_PATH/app` directory after the upload step is finished. Our container's resulting `CMD` will be `dev-deployment-upload-service && ./mvnw quarkus:dev`.

When calling Maven, `./mvnw` is used as the Maven binary is not available globally in this image, and it's not possible to call `mvn` directly.


[IMPORTANT]
====
When deploying to a local Kubernetes cluster configured via the Kubernetes Cluster Wizard from {CANVAS}, the `Command` will need a few more parameters for a Quarkus app:

`./mvnw quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.http.non-application-root-path=/${{ devDeployment.uniqueName }}/q -Dquarkus.http.root-path=/${{ devDeployment.uniqueName }}"`

When deploying to an OpenShift cluster, `./mvnw quarkus:dev` will work without any flags.

This is because the Ingress controller is configured to use sub-paths for each Dev Deployment instead of new subdomains on the Kubernetes cluster, so we need to ensure that the Quarkus app conforms to these sub-paths.
