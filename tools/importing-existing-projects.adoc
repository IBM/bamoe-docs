= Importing existing projects

From the Home page, you can import existing projects in many ways.
They can come from a remote Git repository, a local file or folder from your computer, or even from a URL pointing to a specific Decision or Workflow file.
GitHub Gists and Bitbucket Snippets are also supported.

Let's see how to import files in each of those ways.

=== Uploading files and folders

Simply click on “Select files…” or “Select folder…” to upload your existing work that is stored in your computer.
You can also drag & drop stuff from your computer there.

Uploading Git repositories from your computer will ignore its `.git` directory, meaning that on {CANVAS}, you'll be starting a new repository, without any history.

=== Importing a public Git repository

Paste the your Git repository's URL on the input text.
{CANVAS} will automatically detect the default branch and a matching connected account, based on your repository's URL.

If you want to change the connected account or the branch you're importing, click on “Change…” or “More options…”.

=== Importing a private Git repository

Before being able to import a private Git repository, you need to check if you have any connected account of your Git provider.
This can be done directly from the “Import” section at {CANVAS} home page.
Select “More options…” and paste your repository's URL.
You should see a screen similar to this one:

To connect to an account, open the Authentication select and choose “+ Connect to an account…”.

.“Authentication select” on the “More options…” import modal, from {CANVAS} Home page

This will take you to the Accounts modal, where you can select your Git provider and connect.
Once you're done, you'll be brought back to the Import modal, where you'll see your account select and the main branch already inferred:

Simply click “Clone” and your repository will be imported to {CANVAS}.

{CANVAS} only supports importing private repositories from the predefined Git providers.

=== Importing a GitHub Gist or Bitbucket Snippet

GitHub Gists and Bitbucket Snippets are repositories.
Simply paste the GitHub Gist or Bitbucket Snippet URL and click Clone.
If your Gist is private, follow the steps above for private Git repositories.
Individual Gist and Snippet files can be imported too.

=== Importing an individual file from a URL

{CANVAS} will try to import any URL you paste as a Git repository first.
If it fails to do so, it will proceed to trying to import it as an individual file.
It will look at the file extension of the URL to determine if it's importable or not.
Supported extensions are “dmn”, “bpmn”, and “bpmn2”.
