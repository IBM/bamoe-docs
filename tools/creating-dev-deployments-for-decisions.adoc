= Dev deployments for decisions
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]


{CANVAS} allows connections with both local Kubernetes instances and remote Kubernetes/OpenShift instances.
These connections can be configured via the "Accounts modal", which can be accessed using the person icon in the top-right corner of the page.
Instructions for configuring Kubernetes or OpenShift connections are provided upon selection.
For more detailed information, refer to the
xref:../tools/connecting-accounts.adoc[Connecting accounts] section.

This connection enables the deployment of all Decisions within a project for development purposes only.
With any Decision in the project open, select the connected account intended for the Dev deployment and confirm the selection.

Upon confirmation of the Dev deployment, the Dev deployments dropdown will open, displaying all Decisions that have been deployed.

After approximately 30 seconds, a green checkmark should appear next to the Dev deployment.
Selecting this item in the dropdown will navigate to a special web application provided by BAMOE Canvas for Dev deployments.
This web application allows the selection of a specific Decision from the project to work with and provides a form similar to the DMN Runner.
Additionally, a link to the Swagger UI with the Decisions' API information is provided.

The Decision can be changed using the dropdown in the top-right corner.
The Swagger UI can be opened via the kebab menu located at the top-right corner.
Dev deployments can be used to share work with others or integrate it with other applications that are still under development.

Dev deployments are immutable; therefore, if an error occurs or a change is required, a new Dev deployment must be created.
Dev deployments can be deleted easily from the Dev deployments dropdown.

== Limitations

* All Decisions within the project are included in a Dev deployment.
  If an error exists in any of the Decisions, the Dev deployment will not succeed.
* Currently, only Decisions are supported for deployment.
  Workflows within the project are ignored by the Dev deployment process
