= Creating Dev deployments for Decisions
IBM; KIE Community
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]


{CANVAS} allows you to connect with local Kubernetes instances and/or remote Kubernetes/OpenShift instances.
Setting those up can be done at the “Accounts modal”, which can be opened using the little person icon at the top-right.
Selecting Kubernetes or OpenShift will give you instructions on how to do it.
For more information see “Connecting accounts”.

This connection lets you deploy all Decisions in your project, for development purposes only.
With any Decision of your project open, select the connected account you want to use to make your Dev deployment and confirm.

Once you confirm your Dev deployment, the Dev deployments dropdown will open, and you'll be able to see the Decisions you deployed.

After ~30 seconds you should be able to see your Dev deployment with a green check.
Clicking the item on this dropdown will take you to a special web application {CANVAS} provides for Dev deployments.
This web app lets you select which Decision from your project you want to work with, and provides a form much like DMN Runner's. You get a link for the Swagger UI with your Decisions' API information.

You can change the Decision using the Select at the top-right.
Opening Swagger UI can be done using the little Kebab menu at the top-right.

Use Dev deployments to share your work with others, or even to integrate it with other applications your team might be developing.

Dev deployments are immutable, so if you made a mistake, or simply want to make a change, create a new Dev deployment.
You can easily delete Dev deployments from the Dev deployments dropdown.

== Limitations

* All Decisions inside your project are included in a Dev deployment.
  If there's an error in any of them, the Dev deployment won't succeed.
* Only Decisions are supported at the moment, meaning you can't deploy Workflows.
  If you have Workflows in your project, they're going to be ignored by the Dev deployment.
