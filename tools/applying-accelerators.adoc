= Using Accelerators 
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

Accelerators are project templates that can be applied to existing folders containing Workflows (BPMN), Decisions (DMN), and Rules (DRL), transforming them into complete _Business Service_ projects that can be built, tested, executed, and deployed.

== From existing Decision and Workflow models

{CANVAS} provides a set of useful default Accelerators -- `Quarkus (DMN)` and `Quarkus (Full)`. For other ways to start a _Business Service_ project, see xref:../getting-started/project-setup.adoc[Getting started → Initial _Business Service_ project setup and walkthrough]

When an Accelerator is selected from the "Apply Accelerator" dropdown, a label will be displayed on the project.

Successfully applying an Accelerator creates a `.kie-sandbox` directory at the project root.

This directory will have an `accelerator.yaml` file, which contains all information necessary for the apply operation. 

The file indicates that an Accelerator was applied to the project and should not be removed. 

Clicking on the Accelerator label will open a dialog that shows the `accelerator.yaml` information.

[NOTE]
====
Do not modify the contents of the `accelerator.yaml` file as it is used by {CANVAS} to track the applied Accelerators. Modifying the file may mislead users or break the {CANVAS} integration.
====

To use custom Accelerators, see xref:../installation/canvas.adoc#custom-accelerators[Installation → {CANVAS} -> Configuring custom Accelerators for your organization]
