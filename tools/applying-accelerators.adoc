= Using Accelerators 
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]
Accelerators are project templates that can be applied to existing folders containing Workflows (BPMN), Decisions (DMN), and Rules (DRL), transforming them into complete Business Service projects that can be built, tested, executed, and deployed.

{CANVAS} provides a set of useful default Accelerators -- `Quarkus (DMN)` and `Quarkus (Full)`.
// What There are other ways to create a Business Automation project... clarify the other ways and provide a link

When an Accelerator is selected from the "Apply Accelerator" dropdown, a label will be displayed on the project.

Successfully applying an Accelerator creates a `.kie-sandbox` directory at the project root.

This directory will have an `accelerator.yaml` file, which contains all information necessary for the apply operation. 

The file indicates that an Accelerator was applied to the project and should not be removed. 

Clicking on the Accelerator label will open a dialog that shows the `accelerator.yaml` information.

[NOTE]
====
Do not modify the content of the `accelerator.yaml` file as it may mislead users.
====
// how can you modify the accelerator.yaml file I assume it isn't possible in the dialog and would be a manual update? Perhaps needs rewriting to give context.

You can add custom Accelerators for configurations that are common to all new Business Automation projects within an organization, making them available in {CANVAS} for all users in your organization. For more information see xref:../installation/canvas.adoc[Installing {CANVAS}].
