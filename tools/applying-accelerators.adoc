= Using Accelerators 
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

Accelerators are project templates applied on top of existing Decisions and Workflows, allowing for enhanced development control.
{CANVAS} provides a set of useful accelerators by default, including Quarkus (DMN) Accelerator and Quarkus (Full) Accelerator.

There are many ways to create a Business Automation project, with accelerators being one option.
When an accelerator is selected from the "Apply Accelerator" dropdown, a label will be displayed on the project.

Successfully applying an accelerator creates a `.kie-sandbox` directory at the workspace root.
This directory will have an `accelerator.yaml` file, which contains all information used during the apply operation. 
The file indicates that an accelerator was applied to the workspace and should not be removed. 
Clicking on the accelerator label will open a modal displaying the `accelerator.yaml` information.

[NOTE]
====
It is not recommended to modify the content of the `accelerator.yaml` file as it may mislead users.
====

The set of accelerators available on {CANVAS} can be customized for an organization.
For specific configurations common to all new Business Automation projects within an organization, refer to the xref:../installation/canvas.adoc[Installing Canvas] section.
