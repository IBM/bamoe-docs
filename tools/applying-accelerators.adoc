Accelerators are project templates that get applied on top of your existing Decisions and Workflows, allowing you to develop them with more control.
{CANVAS} provides a useful set of Accelerators out of the box -- Decisions with Quarkus, and Business Automation with Quarkus (*← Not definitive names*).

There are many ways to create a Business Automation project, and Accelerators are one of them.
When you select one from the “Apply accelerator” select, you'll see a label displayed on your project.

Clicking the Accelerator label will open a modal with some relevant information about it.

The set of available Accelerators on {CANVAS} can be customized for your organization.
If you have specific configurations that are common to all new Business Automation projects in your organization, refer to “Installation, {CANVAS}” for more information.
