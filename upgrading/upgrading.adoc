= Upgrading from 9.1.x
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

The usual upgrade path recommended for users is to upgrade to the next version before upgrading to an n+1 version. However because of the similiarites between {VERSION_910} and {VERSION_911} this section describes how to migrate projets and services developed with {PRODUCT_SHORT} {VERSION_910} and {VERSION_911}. 

NOTE: Due to the significant architecture change between {PRODUCT_SHORT} {VERSION_80X} and 9.x, if you haven't already upgraded to {VERSION_90X} or {VERSION_91X}, we do not recommend that you upgrade to {VERSION_920}. When the required features are available in a 9.2.x release the detailed migration procedures will be provided. 

Depending on the complexity of your installation, you might want IBM(R) Services to participate in your project. If so, contact your IBM service representative.

---

This guide will walk you through upgrading your {PRODUCT_SHORT} development environment installation with {MVN_REPO}, {CANVAS}, and {DEV_TOOLS}; your _Busienss Services_ projects; and your {PRODUCT_SHORT} production environment installation with {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} and upgraded versions of your _Business Services_. At the end, if you're using {VERSION_91X} technology preview for stateful Workflows, you'll find upgrade instructions as well.

== Step 1: Download product archives

Start by downloading the product archives from either {PRODUCT_FIX_CENTRAL_PAGE_LINK}[IBM Fix Central] which requires an active support subscription to {PRODUCT}, {PRODUCT_PASSPORT_ADVANTAGE_LINK}[IBM Passport Advantage], or via the {DEV_PROGRAM_PAGE_LINK}[IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions Developer Program].

== Step 2: Upgrade your {PRODUCT_SHORT} development environment installation

When you upgrade your {PRODUCT_SHORT} development environment, you must upgrade {MVN_REPO}, {CANVAS}, and {DEV_TOOLS}. 

=== Upgrade {MVN_REPO}

It is recommended using the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/applications/deployments/route-based-deployment-strategies.html#deployments-blue-green_route-based-deployment-strategies[blue-green deployment strategy] for Maven artifacts to be available for both your current version and {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION}.

If you are using the {MVN_REPO} `.zip` instead of {MVN_REPO} container images, simply extract the contents of {MVN_REPO} `.zip` version {VERSION} to your local Maven repository.

In case you have installed {MVN_REPO} in a Maven Repository Manager such as Artifactory or Nexus, follow the steps in xref:../installation/configure-maven.adoc[Installing → {MVN_REPO}] to install the new {MVN_REPO} version {VERSION}.

=== Upgrade {CANVAS}

The {VERSION} version of {CANVAS} is a drop in replacement for the {VERSION_90x} and {VERSION_91x} versions (see xref:../installation/installation.adoc[Installing → {CANVAS}]). The projects you saved to your browser before the upgrade can simply be opened after installing the new version. 

If you prefer to install a parallel version using https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/applications/deployments/route-based-deployment-strategies.html#deployments-blue-green_route-based-deployment-strategies[blue-green deployment strategies] you can import projects into the newly installed version (see xref:../tools/importing-existing-projects.adoc[Importing existing projects]) if the DNS domains between installations are different, or have your imported projects automatically show up in the new installation when you open it in your browser if the DNS domains between installations are the same.

[NOTE]
====
If you have customized your previous {CANVAS} installation, remember to apply the same Environment Variables to the new installation. The same applies for customized container images for {CANVAS} Dev Deployments.
====

=== Upgrade {DEV_TOOLS}

{DEV_TOOLS} versions are managed by the Extension update mechanism in VS Code. You can set automatic update or manage it manually when notified. Because of version differences in the models supported by the BPMN, DMN, and Test Scenario editors it is recommended to choose when you upgrade to avoid issues when running models in services that have not been upgraded simultaneously.

See xref:../tools/developer-tools-for-vscode.adoc[{DEV_TOOLS}].

[NOTE]
====
After upgrading from {VERSION_90x}, the new DMN Editor will be opened automatically when you first open DMN models in {CANVAS} or {DEV_TOOLS}.
Existing DMN files (any version) can be opened directly in the new DMN Editor. For more information, see xref:../editing/authoring-decisions.adoc[Authoring Decisions].

After upgrading from {VERSION_90x} or {VERSION_91X}, the new Test Scenario Editor (now compatible with DMN 1.5) will also open automatilly when you first open SCESIM files in {DEV_TOOLS}, even when the linked Decision is on an older version (E.g., DMN 1.2).
====

== Step 3: Upgrade your _Business Service_ projects

_Business Service_ projects can be upgraded in two ways, by:

* Creating a _Business Service_ project from scratch and moving your existing assets to it.
* Updating an existing _Business Service_ project with its artifacts by changing the Maven dependencies. 

The following tools are required to upgrade your _Business Service_ projects to {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_920}:

- https://openjdk.org[JDK 17] or later is installed.
- https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven 3.9.6] or later is installed.
- https://code.visualstudio.com/download[Visual Studio Code IDE] latest version installed.
- Upgraded {PRODUCT_SHORT} development environment installation with {MVN_REPO} @ {IMAGE_VERSION}


== Step 3a: Creating a _Business Service_ project on {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} from scratch

Once your {PRODUCT_SHORT} development environment installation is upgraded, you can create a new _Business Service_ project to contan your existing business automation assets (Workflows, Decisions, Rules, and Decision Tables) to the new {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION}.

[WARNING]
====
This is only recommended if you're facing impediments when trying to upgrade your existing _Business Service_ projects to {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION}. Go to xref:../upgrading/upgrading.adoc#step-3b[Step 3b: Upgrade _Business Service_ projects on {PRODUCT_SHORT} versions {VERSION_90X} or {VERSION_91X}] for instructions if you haven't tried that yet.
====

There are several ways to create Maven projects; this approach uses a published Maven plugin.

[start=1]
. In a terminal window, create a new local folder for the new Maven project, for example, `/Users/developer`, and navigate to that folder.

. Create the project using Quarkus and the following Maven commands. 
This creates a Quarkus project called `my-sample-decision-service`, which is versioned `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`, and includes the extensions `resteasy-reactive-jackson, quarkus-smallrye-openapi, quarkus-smallrye-health`.
+
[source,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
mvn io.quarkus.platform:quarkus-maven-plugin:3.15.3:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.ibm.bamoe.samples \
    -DprojectArtifactId=my-sample-decision-service \
    -DprojectVersion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -DplatformGroupId=io.quarkus.platform \
    -DplatformArtifactId=quarkus-bom \
    -Dextensions=resteasy-reactive-jackson,quarkus-smallrye-openapi,quarkus-smallrye-health
----
+
[NOTE]
====
As you can see from the Maven command, there are a number of possible `extensions` that can be added to the project for the specific functionality. 
You can find more information on available extensions at the following locations:  https://quarkus.io/extensions/[Quarkus Extensions], and https://quarkus.io/extensions/?search-regex=kogito[Kogito Extensions].
====
+
When you create this project, you will notice the Maven artifacts being streamed in your console as they are pulled. When the process is complete, you will see a console message like the following:
+
[source,console]
----

----

[start=3]
.  Add the following `properties` to the `pom.xml` file, using the row numbers as a guide.
This specifies the Maven coordinates for the {PRODUCT_SHORT} Maven Bill-of-Materials (BOM), which manages all of the associated dependency versions for a specific {PRODUCT_SHORT} release:
+
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<properties>
  <surefire-plugin.version>3.0.0-M7</surefire-plugin.version>
  <kogito.bom.group-id>com.ibm.bamoe</kogito.bom.group-id>
  <kogito.bom.artifact-id>bamoe-bom</kogito.bom.artifact-id>
  <kogito.bom.version>{BOM_VERSION}</kogito.bom.version>
</properties>
----

[start=4]
. Replace lines 31-37, which essentially add the `bamoe-bom` to the list of imported dependencies:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>${kogito.bom.group-id}</groupId>
  <artifactId>${kogito.bom.artifact-id}</artifactId>
  <version>${kogito.bom.version}</version>
  <type>pom</type>
  <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
----
+
A bill of materials (BOM) is a list of parts or components that are required to build a product.
BOMs are ordinary `pom.xml` files that contain no source code, and their only purpose is to declare their bundled modules.

.Always use the Maven Bill-of-Materials (BOM)
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended to use a bill of materials (BOM) to manage project dependencies, as it simplifies dependency management by organizing a group of dependencies under a single version. 

The use of a Maven bill-of-materials (BOM) does not add any dependencies to the project.
Rather, it functions as a reference for managing the versions of your project dependencies (and transient dependencies).
====    

A bill of materials (BOM) can be added to an existing POM file by adding it to the **_dependencyManagement_** section as a dependency with a pom type:

include::../partials/maven-bom-now.adoc[]

When a bill of materials (BOM) is used, it is not necessary to specify the version of the dependency, as that appears from the BOM, so your dependencies will resemble the following:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
  <artifactId>drools-compiler</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[NOTE]
====
During the course of your Maven dependency update, if you encounter any dependencies that are not included in the bill of materials (BOM) please report it to IBM to be resolved.
====

See xref:../introduction/release-notes/version-mapping.adoc[version mapping].

[start=5]
. Add the `IBM ILMT Compliance Library` to the `pom.xml`  _(this is required  to report on subscription entitlement usage within the system)_:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ibm.bamoe</groupId>
  <artifactId>bamoe-ilmt-compliance-quarkus-dmoe</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[NOTE]
====
You might notice that the newly added Maven dependency includes the `groupId` and `artifactId` portions of the Maven coordinates but does not specify a `version` tag.
This is due to importing the `bamoe-bom` into the project, where the various dependency versions are managed.
====

[start=6]
. Add the dependencies.
+
For this example, you will be creating a project with only DMN files.
So you must add the `drools-quarkus-decisions` dependency.
In the {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_91x} some dependencies had a slight name change, see section, https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe/9.1.x?topic=installing-upgrading[Maven libraries mapping guide] and update accordingly.
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
  <artifactId>drools-quarkus-decisions</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
+

[start=7]
. Disable Quarkus Dev Services.
+
Currently, the Quarkus Dev Services is not fully supported and hence it is required to disable this feature by adding the following line to the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:
+ 
[source]
----
quarkus.devservices.enabled=false
----

[start=8]
. Build the project in the root folder:
+ 
[source,shell]
----
mvn clean package
----
+
You might get Maven streaming text once again, and at the end of it you will see:

[NOTE]
====
The choice of extensions determines the imported behavior of the project including adding sample models or testing related code.
====

[start=9]
. Add and update Business Automation assets
+
After the project is generated, you will see a project structure in VS Code, similar to the following diagram:
+
.Example Maven Project in VS Code
image::maven-project.png[Example Maven project in VS Code]
+
As you can see from the figure, a Maven compliant project is generated, including all of the standard folders typically found in a Maven project.
The most significant folder is the `resources` folder, which is where new or upgraded business automation asset files must be stored.
Examples of supported business automation assets are:
+
- Decision Model & Notation (DMN) decisions (.dmn)
- Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules (.drl)
- Business Process Modeling & Notation (BPMN) workflows (.bpmn)
- Spreadsheet Decision Table files (.xls or .xlsx)
- Standard Properties files (.properties)
- Test Scenario files (.scesim)
+
[NOTE]
====
The proper folder for unit test files is `src/test/resources`, as this is a testing resource.
====
+
Now, copy all your assets from the {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_901} project to the respective folders on the new project.
As the new project uses Quarkus 3, you must make a few more updates.
One of the biggest changes is that Quarkus 3 uses Jarkarta EE 10. You need to update all `javax` to `jakarta`.
This is simply achieved by replacing any `javax` instance over `jarkarta`, like the following:
+
[source,diff]
----
 --- import javax.inject.Named;
 +++ import jakarta.inject.Named;
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Refer https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.0[Quarkus v3 migration guide] for any other change that is related to Quarkus.
====

[start=10]
. Build the project one more time.
+
[source,console]
----
mvn clean package
----
+
You might get Maven streaming text once again, and at the end of it you must have:

Now you can start using your {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} project.

=== Add Business Automation Assets

If your project is upgraded from a previous version of the product, you can add the business automation files from the previous project to the `src/main/resources` folder of the new project by copying the files between projects.

[NOTE]
====
After completing the upgrade of your _Business Service_ project, you might want to consider upgrading your business Rules to use new DRL features, such as `rule units` and `OOPATH syntax`.

Refer to xref:reference-guide/drl.html[Reference → Drools Rule Language (DRL)] for information on upgrading to the latest version of Drools Rule Language (DRL).
====

[#step-3b]
== Step 3b: Upgrade _Business Service_ projects on {PRODUCT_SHORT} versions {VERSION_90X} or {VERSION_91X}

Upgrading a _Business Service_ project on {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_90x} or {VERSION_91x} to {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} is straightforward.

The project structure is not changed, updates only need to be made to the dependencies versions, some dependency names, and files.

[start=1]
. Upgrade the Quarkus version in the project POM file to the currently supported version `3.15 (LTS)`:


[start=2]
. Upgrade the BAMOE BOM in the project POM file to {BOM_VERSION_920}:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ibm.bamoe</groupId>
  <artifactId>bamoe-bom</artifactId>
  <version>{BOM_VERSION}</version>
  <type>pom</type>
  <scope>import</scope>
  <type>
</dependency>
----
+

[start=3]
. If you are upgrading from {VERSION_90X}, you'll need to update some dependencies GAVs.
+
In the {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_91x} some dependencies had a slight name change, see section https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe/9.1.x?topic=installing-upgrading[Maven libraries mapping guide @ 9.1.x] first and update accordingly.
+
One of the renamed dependencies is the `groupdId=org.kie.kogito` and `artifactId=kogito-quarkus`, which was renamed to `groupdId=org.jbpm` and `jbpm-with-drools-quarkus`.
+
[source,xml]
----
 ---   <dependency>
 ---     <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
 ---     <artifactId>kogito-quarkus</artifactId>
 ---   </dependency>
 +++   <dependency>
 +++     <groupId>org.jbpm</groupId>
 +++     <artifactId>jbpm-with-drools-quarkus</artifactId>
 +++   </dependency>
----
+
Depending on your project setup you may also need to make changes to a parent `pom.xml`if it exists. This is not covered here.

[start=4]
. Update the `application.properties` file.
+
{PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} does not fully support the Quarkus Dev Services and hence it is required to disable this feature by adding the following line to the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:

+
[source,diff]
----
 +++ quarkus.devservices.enabled=false
----

[start=5]
. Upgrade the code to Quarkus 3 if you are upgrading from {VERSION_90X}
+
A major Quarkus 3 change, is the usage of Jakarta EE 10, meaning that package imports also need to update from `javax` to `jakarta`.
+
This is simply achieved by replacing any `javax` instance over `jarkarta`, like the following:
+
[source,diff]
----
 --- import javax.inject.Named;
 +++ import jakarta.inject.Named;
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Refer https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.0[Quarkus v3 migration guide] for any other change that is related to Quarkus.
====

[start=6]
. Build the project in the root folder:
+
[source,console]
----
mvn clean package
----
+
You might get Maven streaming text once again, and at the end you will see:
+
[source,console]
----
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

After completing the upgrade of your _Business Service_ project, you might want to consider upgrading your business Rules to use new DRL features, such as `rule units` and `OOPATH syntax`.

Refer to xref:reference-guide/drl.html[Reference → Drools Rule Language (DRL)] for information on upgrading to the latest version of Drools Rule Language (DRL).
====

Now, you can start using your {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} project.

== Step 4: Upgrade your {PRODUCT_SHORT} production environment installation

After upgrading your _Business Services_ source code (Steps 3a or 3b), you need to upgrade {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} before deploying a new version of the upgraded _Business Services_.

It is recommended using the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/applications/deployments/route-based-deployment-strategies.html#deployments-blue-green_route-based-deployment-strategies[blue-green deployment strategy] for upgrading {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} so that you still have a reliable way of managing live _Business Services_ that might not have been upgraded {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} yet. Once all your _Business Services_ are running {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION}, you can safely remove your previous {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} installation.

If your getting started with stateful Workflows, follow xref:../installation/management-console.adoc[Installing → {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE}] for installing {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} for the first time in your production environment.

Once you have a new installation for {MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE} version {VERSION}, you can follow the standard guidance on how to deploy a new version of your _Business Services_. See xref:../runtime-services-modeling/services-deployment.adoc[Building Business Services] and xref:../runtime-services-modeling/services-deployment.adoc[Deploying Business Services] for recommendations on how to do it.

[#migrate-tech-preview]
== Upgrading from {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_911} technology preview for stateful Workflows

In the {VERSION_911} technology preview the general Process API was used to call your stateful process. In this version a new User Tasks API is built on top of a dedicated User Tasks subsystem. As a direct impact of that there are three key changes to be taken into account:

* The new API does not require global parameters related to the whole process (such as `process ID`, `process instance ID` and `task name`). The `task ID`` is the key and most of the time it is the only actor to operate with the new API. 
+
In version {VERSION_911}, the General Process API entrypoints are based on the following pattern:
+
`http://<host:port>/<process-id>/<process-instance>/<task-name>/<task-instance-id>`
+
In version {VERSION} the User Task API entrypoints are based on the following pattern:
+
`http://<host:port>/<usertasks>/<instance>/<task-instance-id>`

* The Task ID used in the User Tasks is not the same ID required in the Process API. The reason for this behavior is that the new API relies on a new subsystem. The subsystem base has its own IDs, that are not recognized by the Process API. This is an important point to understand before you start upgrading to the new API. 
+
For example the `<task instance id>` referenced in the General Process API call:
+
`http://<host:port>/<process-id>/<process-instance>/<task-name>/<task-instance-id>`
+
and
+
`http://<host:port>/usertasks/instance/<task-instance-id>`
+
You must upgrade all entry points in your application to use the User Task API layers when operating with User Tasks. 

* The Returned JSON object contains more detailed data. You will therefore need to adapt how the entrypoint data is consumed by your application.

The following sections show how the API calls changed based
on the most important use cases:

[cols=",",]
|===
2+| *Example 1 - Show Tasks assigned to a user / groups*

|*Process API* |curl -X GET ++\++

'http://localhost:8080/++{++processId}/++{++uuid}/tasks?user=manager&group=managers'

|*User Task API* a|
curl -X GET ++\++

'http://localhost:8080/usertasks/instance?group=managers&user=manager'
|===

[cols=",",]
|===
2+|*Example 2 - Show a precise Task assigned to a user / groups*

|*Process API* a|
curl -X GET ++\++

'http://localhost:8080__/++{++__processId__}/++{++__processInstance__}/__++{++taskName}/++{++taskId}?user=manager'

|*New API* a|
curl -X GET ++\++

'http://localhost:8080/usertasks/instance/++{++taskId}?group=managers&user=manager'
|===

The JSON returned by the User Task API to represent a Task is significantly different from the JSON returned by the Process API.

Here, an example of the two returned objects for both endpoints.

The new User Tasks API returns the following information:

[source,json,subs="attributes+"]
----
{
    "id": "e447c247-abc2-4ed4-a7ab-ef4ee2fe4a71",

    }
  }

While the Process API returns the following task information:

[source,json,subs="attributes+"]
----
[
  {
    "id": "c7f40ec0-0272-4e04-9f0b-91ffe78d2590",

      }
    },
    "results": {
      "approved": null
    }
  }
]
----

The main differences are:

* The User Tasks IDs will not be the same.
+
The assigned ID for the Task in the new User Tasks API
(e447c247-abc2-4ed4-a7ab-ef4ee2fe4a71) is scoped inside the User Tasks
subsystem, and can only be used in that subsystem. It is the ID to be used as taskID parameter in all the
entrypoints defined in the new User Tasks API. The rest of the engine is
out of scope. Using this task ID in a Process API entrypoint
will lead to an error.

* The `externalReferenceId` element represents the Work Item ID, which is how the Process API identifies a User Task at the global level. The value is the same as the Task ID if you use Process API. 

* New data related to the assigned permissions for the Tasks
has been added, such as the actual owner, potential users and groups and excluded users

* The `parameters` object present in the old API has become `inputs` and `outputs`. These represents a Map of String, Objects entries that you can set
as the User Task input or output. You can modify this list adding more entries with a specific entrypoint.

* The new API Task object now contains a Metadata object. This contains relevant properties that describes the BPMN asset 

With the dedicated API for User Tasks, it is now possible to directly put new Input and Output data for a given User Task, using the following entrypoints:

Similar operations (GET, DELETE) can be performed against Comments and
Attachments. The precise endpoint definitions are shown above.

The following examples show how to apply a transition to a given User Task.
The transition scope is to advance a User Task status, moving it from one status to another (transitionID), where the status can be: "activate", "claim", "release", "complete", "skip", or “fail”. The following example shows how to complete a User Task.

2+|*Example 7 - Approve User Task*

|*Process API* a|
curl -X POST ++\++
'http://localhost:8080/++{++processId}/++{++uuid}/++{++taskName}/++{++taskId}?user=admin&group=managers'
++\++

-H 'accept: application/json' ++\++

-H 'Content-Type: application/json' ++\++

-d '++{++

"approved": "true"

}'

OR

curl -X POST ++\++
'http://localhost:8080/++{++processId}/++{++uuid}/++{++taskName}/++{++taskId}/phases/++{++phaseId}?user=admin&group=managers'
++\++

-H 'accept: application/json' ++\++

-H 'Content-Type: application/json' ++\++

-d '++{++

"approved": "true"

}'

|*New API* a|
curl -X POST ++\++

'http://localhost:8080/usertasks/instance/++{++taskId}/transition?group=managers&user=manager'
++\++

-H 'accept: application/json' ++\++

-H 'Content-Type: application/json' ++\++

-d '++{++

"transitionId": "complete"

}' 
|===

With the Process API there are two ways to change the
User Task status. With the first entrypoint, the User Tasks change its
status to complete, without specifying the phaseId. The second
entrypoint gives the ability to pass a specific phaseId different than
“complete”. It is possible to pass output values in the same call (E.g.,
“approved” = true)

The new User Task API requires that the transitionID is defined in the
JSON payload, as in the example below. It is no longer possible to pass
output values as was done in the Process API, so if you need to put some output
data, you need to call the Add Output entypoint described later.

A new feature that the new User Tasks API introduced is to provide an
endpoint that returns all reachable statuses that a given User Task can
reach from the current status.
