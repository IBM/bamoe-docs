= Upgrading from 9.0.x

include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]


You can upgrade your existing business automation applications and platforms to the most recent version of {PRODUCT_LONG}. If you are upgrading from an older version, you must follow the steps to upgrade to each intermediate version, as documented. Depending on the complexity of your installation, you might want IBM(R) Services to participate in your project. If so, contact your IBM service representative.

If you want to know more on how to upgrade from version {VERSION_80} to version {VERSION_90X}, see https://ibmdocs-test.dcs.ibm.com/docs/en/ibamoe/9.0.x?topic=upgrading[Upgrading]

//The above link to Upgrade has to be changed to external site during release 

This section will walk you through upgrading your:

* {PRODUCT_SHORT} development environment installation with {MVN_REPO}, {CANVAS}, {DEV_TOOLS}, and {FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}.

* _Business Service(s)_ project(s)

* {PRODUCT_SHORT} production environment installation with Management and Task console, and upgraded versions of your _Business Services_.

== Step 1: Download product archives

Start by downloading the product archives from either https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral[IBM Fix Central] which requires an active support subscription to {PRODUCT}, {PRODUCT_PASSPORT_ADVANTAGE_LINK}[IBM Passport Advantage], or via the {DEV_PROGRAM_PAGE_LINK}[IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions Developer Program]. For more information, see https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7151078[BAMOE 9.1 Download Document].

== Step 2: Upgrade your {PRODUCT_SHORT} development environment installation

When you upgrade your {PRODUCT_SHORT} development environment, you must upgrade {MVN_REPO}, {CANVAS}, {DEV_TOOLS} and {FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}. 

=== Upgrade {MVN_REPO}

On the {PRODUCT} version {VERSION_90x} the dependencies were hosted on the https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=bamoe[Maven Central].
Now the dependencies are distributed with a container image or a zip file.
For more information, see {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} xref:../installation/configure-maven.adoc[Maven configuration].

It is recommended using the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/applications/deployments/route-based-deployment-strategies.html#deployments-blue-green_route-based-deployment-strategies[blue-green deployment strategy] for Maven artifacts to be available for both your current version and {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_91X}.

If you are using the {MVN_REPO} `.zip` instead of {MVN_REPO} container images, simply extract the contents of {MVN_REPO} `.zip` version {VERSION_91X} to your local Maven repository.

=== Upgrade {CANVAS}

The {VERSION_91X} version of {CANVAS} is a drop in replacement for the {VERSION_90X} version (see xref:../installation/installation.adoc[Installing â†’ {CANVAS}]). The projects you saved to your browser before the upgrade can simply be opened after installing the new version. 

If you prefer to install a parallel version using https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/applications/deployments/route-based-deployment-strategies.html#deployments-blue-green_route-based-deployment-strategies[blue-green deployment strategies] you can import projects into the newly installed version (see xref:../tools/importing-existing-projects.adoc[Importing existing projects]) as long as the DNS domains between installations are different. If the DNS domains between installations are the same, your imported projects automatically show up in the new installation when you open it in your browser.

[NOTE]
====
If you have customized your previous {CANVAS} installation, remember to apply the same Environment Variables to the new installation. The same applies for customized container images for {CANVAS} Dev Deployments.
====

=== Upgrade {DEV_TOOLS}

{DEV_TOOLS} versions are managed by the Extension update mechanism in VS Code. You can set automatic update or manage it manually when notified. Because of version differences in the models supported by the BPMN, DMN, and Test Scenario editors it is recommended to choose when you upgrade to avoid issues when running models in services that have not been upgraded when the tools are upgraded.

See xref:../tools/developer-tools-for-vscode.adoc[{DEV_TOOLS}].

[NOTE]
====
After upgrading, the New DMN Editor will be opened automatically when you first access it in Canvas or Developer tools for VS Code.
Existing DMN files (any version) can be opened directly in the editor. For more information, see xref:../editing/authoring-decisions.adoc[Authoring decisions].
====

=== Upgrade {FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}

This tool is required for workflow execution. If the {FORM_GENERATION_TOOL} is already present, uninstall and re-install using steps available in xref:../tools/form-generation-tool.adoc[Form generation tool].

== Step 3: Upgrade your _Business Service(s)_ project(s)

_Business Service(s)_ project(s) can be upgraded in two ways, by:

* Updating an existing _Business Service_ project with its artifacts by changing the Maven dependencies. 

* Creating a _Business Service_ project from scratch and moving your existing assets to it.

The following tools are required to upgrade your _Business Service_ projects to version {VERSION_91X}:

- https://openjdk.org[JDK 17] is installed.
- https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven 3.9.6] or later is installed.
- https://code.visualstudio.com/download[Visual Studio Code IDE] latest version installed.
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.bamoe-developer-tools[IBM {DEV_TOOLS}] latest version of VS Code IDE extensions
- Upgraded {PRODUCT_SHORT} development environment installation with {MVN_REPO} @ {IMAGE_VERSION_911}.
- Quarkus version {QUARKUS_VERSION} or later is installed.

== Step 3a: Upgrade _Business Service(s)_ project(s) on version {VERSION_90X}

Once your development environment installation is upgraded, it is straightforward to upgrade your _Business Service(s)_ project(s) on {PRODUCT_SHORT} {VERSION_90x} to {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_91x}.

The project structure is not changed, updates only need to be made to the dependencies versions, some dependency names, and files.

[WARNING]
====
If you come across some difficulties when trying to upgrade your existing _Business Service(s)_ project(s), you are recommended to create a new project following xref:#step-3b[Step 3b: Upgrade Business Service projects on versions {VERSION_90X}].
====

[start=1]
. Upgrade the Quarkus version in the project POM file to the currently supported version `3.8.6`.
To make this upgrade, open the POM file and do the changes.

+
[source,xml]
----
 ---   <quarkus-plugin.version>2.16.10.Final</quarkus-plugin.version>
 +++   <quarkus-plugin.version>3.8.6</quarkus-plugin.version>
       <quarkus.platform.artifact-id>quarkus-bom</quarkus.platform.artifact-id>
       <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus</quarkus.platform.group-id>
 ---   <quarkus.platform.version>2.16.12.Final</quarkus.platform.version>
 +++   <quarkus.platform.version>3.8.6</quarkus.platform.version>
----

[start=2]
. Upgrade the BOM and Kogito versions in your POM xml.

+
Previously, the {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_90x} used the BOM version {BOM_VERSION_901} and Kogito version {KOGITO_VERSION_901}.
Now, both versions are {BOM_VERSION_911}.
Update the following lines in your `pom.xml`:
+
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
       <kogito.bom.artifact-id>bamoe-bom</kogito.bom.artifact-id>
 ---   <kogito.bom.version>{BOM_VERSION_901}</kogito.bom.version>
 ---   <version.org.kie.kogito>{KOGITO_VERSION_901}</version.org.kie.kogito>
 +++   <kogito.bom.version>{BOM_VERSION_911}</kogito.bom.version>
 +++   <version.org.kie.kogito>{KOGITO_VERSION_911}</version.org.kie.kogito>
----

[start=3]
. Update the Maven GAV dependencies.
+
With the transition of the KIE projets to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), it has become necessary to rename a number of Maven modules.  The following table(s) describe the changes to the Maven GAV (GroupID/ArtifactID/Version):

* xref:../upgrading/gav-mapping-rules.adoc[Drools Maven mappings] for anything related to rules or decisions.
* xref:../upgrading/gav-mapping-process.adoc[jBPM Maven mappings] for anything related to BPMN-based stateless/stateful processes.
* xref:../upgrading/gav-mapping-kogito.adoc[Kogito Maven mappings] for anything related to infrastructure or extended services.
* xref:../upgrading/gav-mapping-kie.adoc[KIE Maven mappings] for anything else that does not fall into the above categories.

Depending on your project setup you may also need to make changes to a parent POM xml if it exists.

[start=4]
. Update the `application.properties` file.
+
{PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_91x} does not fully support the Quarkus Dev Services and hence it is required to disable this feature by adding the following line to the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:

+
[source,diff]
----
 +++ quarkus.devservices.enabled=false
----

[start=5]
. Upgrading the code to Quarkus 3.
+
A major Quarkus 3 change, is the usage of Jakarta EE 10, meaning that package imports also need to update from `javax` to `jakarta`.
+
This is simply achieved by replacing any `javax` instance over `jarkarta`, like the following:
+
[source]
----
 --- import javax.inject.Named;
 +++ import jakarta.inject.Named;
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Refer https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.0[Quarkus v3 migration guide] for any other change that is related to Quarkus.
====

[start=6]
. Build the project in the root folder:
+
[source,console]
----
mvn clean package
----
+
You might get Maven streaming text once again, and at the end you will see:
+
[source,console]
----
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  8.023 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2024-06-11T17:09:00-03:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----
+

[NOTE]
====
After completing the upgrade of the project, you might want to consider upgrading your technical rules to use new language features, such as `rule units` and `OOPATH syntax`.
Refer to xref:../reference-guide/drl.adoc[Drools Rule Language Migration] for information on upgrading to the latest version of Drools Rule Language (DRL).
====

Now, you can start using your {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_91X} project.


== Step 3b: Creating a _Business Service_ project on version {VERSION_91x} from scratch

If you have experienced some difficulties when trying to upgrade your project you can create a new _Business Service_ project from scratch and import your existing business automation assets (Workflows, Decisions, Rules, and Decision Tables) to the new project.

For more information, see xref:../getting-started/project-setup.adoc[Getting started â†’ Initial Business Service project setup and walkthrough] to create a new _Business Service_ project on {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_91x}.

The most significant folder is `src/main/resources`, which is where new or upgraded business automation asset files must be stored.

Examples of supported business automation assets are:

- Decision Model & Notation (DMN) decisions (`.dmn`)
- Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules (`.drl`)
- Business Process Modeling & Notation (BPMN) workflows (`.bpmn`)
- Spreadsheet Decision Table files (`.xls` or `.xlsx`)
- Standard Properties files (`.properties`)
- Test Scenario Files (.scesim)

Copy all your assets from your _Business Service_ project to the respective folders on the new project on {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_91x}. If you have custom Java code or any other type of file in your _Business Service_ project, move them to the same location as you had before, following https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html[Maven's standard  directory layout].

[NOTE]
====
The proper folder for Test Scenario files is `src/test/resources`.
====

There are several ways to create Maven projects; this approach uses a published Maven plugin.

[start=1]
. In a terminal window, create a new local folder for the new Maven project, for example, `/Users/developer`, and navigate to that folder.

. Create the project using Quarkus and the following Maven commands. 
This creates a Quarkus project called `my-sample-decision-service`, which is versioned `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`, and includes the extensions `resteasy-reactive-jackson, quarkus-smallrye-openapi, quarkus-smallrye-health`.
+
[source,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
mvn io.quarkus.platform:quarkus-maven-plugin:3.8.6:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.ibm.bamoe.samples \
    -DprojectArtifactId=my-sample-decision-service \
    -DprojectVersion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -DplatformGroupId=io.quarkus.platform \
    -DplatformArtifactId=quarkus-bom \
    -Dextensions=resteasy-reactive-jackson,quarkus-smallrye-openapi,quarkus-smallrye-health
----
+
[NOTE]
====
As you can see from the Maven command, there are a number of possible `extensions` that can be added to the project for the specific functionality. 
You can find more information on available extensions at the following locations:  https://quarkus.io/extensions/[Quarkus Extensions], and https://quarkus.io/extensions/?search-regex=kogito[Kogito Extensions].
====
+
When you create this project, you will notice the Maven artifacts being streamed in your console as they are pulled. When the process is complete, you will see a console message like the following:
+
[source,console]
----
[INFO]
[INFO] ========================================================================================
[INFO] Your new application has been created in /Users/developer/my-sample-decision-service
[INFO] Navigate into this directory and launch your application with mvn quarkus:dev

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

[start=3]
.  Add the following `properties` to the `pom.xml` file, using the row numbers as a guide.
This specifies the Maven coordinates for the {PRODUCT_SHORT} Maven Bill-of-Materials (BOM), which manages all of the associated dependency versions for a specific {PRODUCT_SHORT} release:
+
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
17   <surefire-plugin.version>{SUREFIRE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}</surefire-plugin.version>
18   <kogito.bom.group-id>com.ibm.bamoe</kogito.bom.group-id>
19   <kogito.bom.artifact-id>bamoe-bom</kogito.bom.artifact-id>
20   <kogito.bom.version>{BOM_VERSION}</kogito.bom.version>
21 </properties>
----

[start=4]
. Replace lines 31-37, which essentially add the `bamoe-bom` to the list of imported dependencies:
+
[source,xml]
----
31  <dependency>
32    <groupId>${kogito.bom.group-id}</groupId>
33    <artifactId>${kogito.bom.artifact-id}</artifactId>
34    <version>${kogito.bom.version}</version>
35    <type>pom</type>
36    <scope>import</scope>
37  </dependency>
----
+
A bill of materials (BOM) is a list of parts or components that are required to build a product.
BOMs are ordinary `pom.xml` files that contain no source code, and their only purpose is to declare their bundled modules.

.Always use the Maven Bill-of-Materials (BOM)
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended to use a bill of materials (BOM) to manage project dependencies, as it simplifies dependency management by organizing a group of dependencies under a single version. 

The use of a Maven bill-of-materials (BOM) does not add any dependencies to the project.
Rather, it functions as a reference for managing the versions of your project dependencies (and transient dependencies).
====    

A bill of materials (BOM) can be added to an existing POM file by adding it to the **_dependencyManagement_** section as a dependency with a pom type:

include::../partials/maven-bom-now.adoc[]

When a bill of materials (BOM) is used, it is not necessary to specify the version of the dependency, as that appears from the BOM, so your dependencies will resemble the following:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
        <artifactId>drools-compiler</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

[NOTE]
====
During the course of your Maven dependency update, if you encounter any dependencies that are not included in the bill of materials (BOM) please report it to IBM to be resolved.
====

See xref:../introduction/release-notes/version-mapping.adoc[version mapping for {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_91X}].

[start=5]
. Add the `IBM ILMT Compliance Library` to the `pom.xml`  _(this is required  to report on subscription entitlement usage within the system)_:
+
[source,xml]
----
40  <dependencies>
41    <dependency>
42      <groupId>com.ibm.bamoe</groupId>
43      <artifactId>bamoe-ilmt-compliance-quarkus-dmoe</artifactId>
44    </dependency>
----

[NOTE]
====
You might notice that the newly added Maven dependency includes the `groupId` and `artifactId` portions of the Maven coordinates but does not specify a `version` tag.
This is due to importing the `bamoe-bom` into the project, where the various dependency versions are managed.
====

[start=6]
. Add the dependencies.
+
For this example, you will be creating a project with only DMN files.
So you must add the the Drools Kogito Quarkus dependency.
In the {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} some dependencies had a slight name change, see section, 'Maven libraries mapping guide' and update accordingly.
+
[source,xml]
----
45 <dependency>
46   <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
47   <artifactId>drools-quarkus-decisions</artifactId>
48 </dependency>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Depending on the project files you may be required to add other dependencies.
====

[start=7]
. Disable Quarkus Dev Services.
+
Currently, the Quarkus Dev Services is not fully supported and hence it is required to disable this feature by adding the following line to the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:
+ 
[source]
----
quarkus.devservices.enabled=false
----

[start=8]
. Build the project in the root folder:
+ 
[source,console]
----
mvn clean package
----
+
You might get Maven streaming text once again, and at the end of it you will see:
+
[source,console]
----
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The choice of extensions determines the imported behavior of the project including adding sample models or testing related code.
====

[start=9]
. Add and update Business Automation assets
+
After the project is generated, you will see a project structure in VS Code, similar to the following diagram:
+
.Example Maven Project in VS Code
image::maven-project.png[Example Maven Project in VS Code]
+
As you can see from the figure, a Maven compliant project is generated, including all of the standard folders typically found in a Maven project.
The most significant folder is the `resources` folder, which is where new or upgraded business automation asset files must be stored.
+
[NOTE]
====
The proper folder for unit test files is `src/test/resources`, as this is a testing resource.
====
+
Now, copy all your assets from the {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_90X} project to the respective folders on the new project.
As the new project uses Quarkus 3, you must make a few more updates.
One of the biggest changes is that Quarkus 3 uses Jarkarta EE 10. You need to update all `javax` to `jakarta`.
This is simply achieved by replacing any `javax` instance over `jarkarta`, like the following:
+
[source,diff]
----
 --- import javax.inject.Named;
 +++ import jakarta.inject.Named;
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Refer https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.0[Quarkus v3 migration guide] for any other change that is related to Quarkus.
====

[start=10]
. Build the project one more time.
+
[source,console]
----
mvn clean package
----
+
You might get Maven streaming text once again, and at the end of it you must have:
+
[source,console]
----
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

----
+
Now you can start using your {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_91X} project.

== Step 4: Verify the upgrade of your _Business Service(s)_ project(s)
. To verify that your upgrade is successful, build the project one more time using Maven's standard command or any other customized build command you might have in your project.
+
[source,console]
----
mvn clean package
----
+
You might get Maven streaming text once again, and at the end of it you must have:
+
[source,console]
----
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  8.023 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2024-06-11T17:09:00-03:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----
+
Now you can start using your _Business Service_ project on {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_91X}.

== Step 5: Upgrade your {PRODUCT_SHORT} production environment installation

After upgrading your _Business Services_ source code (Steps 3a or 3b), you need to upgrade Management and Task console before deploying a new version of the upgraded _Business Services_.

It is recommended that you use the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/applications/deployments/route-based-deployment-strategies.html#deployments-blue-green_route-based-deployment-strategies[blue-green deployment strategy] for upgrading Management and Task console so that you still have a reliable way of managing live _Business Services_ that might not have been upgraded to {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_91X} yet. Once all your _Business Services_ are running, you can safely remove your previous Management and Task console installation.

If you are getting started with stateful Workflows, follow instructions in xref:../installation/installation.adoc[Installing] for information on initial project setup and walkthrough.

Once you have a new installation, you can follow the standard guidance on how to deploy a new version of your _Business Services_ (see xref:../runtime-services-modeling/building-decision-services.adoc[Building decision services]).
