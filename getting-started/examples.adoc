^|Title
^|Description

| decisiontable-quarkus-example | A rule service to validate LoanApplication fact. Rules are written as a Decision Table.
| decisiontable-springboot-example | Same as above but for Spring Boot.
| dmn-15-quarkus-example | A basic starting empty project to get started
| dmn-15-springboot-example | Same as above but for Spring Boot.
| dmn-drools-quarkus-metrics | This example demonstrates how to enable and consume the runtime metrics monitoring feature in Kogito.
| dmn-drools-springboot-metrics | Same as above but for Spring Boot.
| dmn-event-driven-quarkus | This example demonstrates the capability of the Kogito Event-Driven Decisions Add-on: to enable, when included as dependency of a simple DMN service, to trigger evaluations of its models and receive the corresponding results via specific CloudEvents.
| dmn-event-driven-springboot | Same as above but for Spring Boot.
| dmn-knative-quickstart-quarkus | A quickstart project that deals with "Traffic Violation" DMN model. It illustrates how easy it is to make the Kogito decisions to work with Knative Eventing.
| dmn-listener-dtable | An extension of the example dmn-quarkus-listener, focusing on semantic asynchronous evaluation of AfterEvaluateDecisionTableEvent(s) using Quarkus capabilities.
| dmn-listener-quarkus | A simple DMN service to evaluate a traffic violation, with the addition of some DMN listeners.
| dmn-listener-springboot | Same as above but for Spring Boot.
| dmn-multiple-models-quarkus-example | A simple DMN service to evaluate different models (traffic violation, habitability) with also importing feature (traffic violation).
| dmn-quarkus-example | A simple DMN service to evaluate a traffic violation.
| dmn-springboot-example | Same as above but for Spring Boot.
| dmn-resource-jar-quarkus-example | A simple DMN service to evaluate a model (traffic violation) that is imported from a different jar.
| dmn-resource-jar-springboot-example | Same as above but for Spring Boot.
| process-accelerator | A project that showcases the recommended {PRODUCT_SHORT} _Business Service_ configuration.
| process-business-calendar | A basic project showcasing how to use the Business Calendar in a _Business Service_ project.
| process-business-rules-quarkus | A basic business rules and processes example using DRL and the business rules task.
| process-compact-architecture | This example showcases a basic implementation of the Hiring process that drives a Candidate through different interviews until the candidate gets hired. It demonstrates how to embed the process subsystems in a single application, removing the need for events between them.
| process-decisions-quarkus | This is an example project that shows the usage of decisions within processes. Decisions can be expressed in different domains or assets, such as DMN and DRL. The focus here is to show how to integrate decisions in an embedded way using Business Rule Task where they must be deployed together with the process, in the same application.
| process-decisions-rest-quarkus | The focus here is to show how to integrate decisions in a remote way using REST APIs where they can be deployed decoupled from the process service, for instance, in different microservices with its build and deployment pipelines.
| process-decisions-rules-quarkus | This is an example project that shows the usage of decisions within processes. Decisions can be expressed in different domains or assets, such as DMN and DRL. The focus here is to show how to integrate decisions in an embedded way using Business Rule Task where they must be deployed together with the process, in the same application. Contains additional validations.
| process-error-handling | A simple usage scenario of the Error Handling Strategy.
| process-event-driven | A basic project that uses Kafka to showcase the configuration and usage of events between _Business Services_.
| process-monitoring-quarkus | This example demonstrates how to enable and consume the runtime metrics monitoring feature in Kogito with processes.
| process-persistence | A quickstart project that processes deals for travellers, it utilizes PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server as durable storage.
| process-postgresql-persistence-quarkus | A quickstart project that processes deals for travellers, it utilizes PostgreSQL as durable storage.
| process-rest-service-call-quarkus | A quickstart project that processes users in the system. It’s main purpose is to to call external REST service to load a given user by its username.
| process-rest-workitem-multi-quarkus | This example contains a BPMN that performs two consecutive REST invocations using RestWorkItemHandler, an alternative declarative approach to service programatic calls.
| process-rest-workitem-quarkus | A quickstart project that processes users in the system. It’s main purpose is to to call external REST service to load a given user by its username.
| process-saga-quarkus | Service to demonstrate how to implement Saga pattern based on BPMN process with Kogito.
| process-scripts-quarkus | A quickstart project is the simplest hello world kind of example, it accepts input and replies with hello message.
| process-security | A basic project showcasing the configuration and usage of the {PRODUCT_SHORT} _Business Service_ security features.
| process-service-calls-quarkus | A quickstart project that processes travellers in the system. It’s main purpose is to illustrate local service invocation.
| process-user-tasks-subsystem | A basic project showcasing the usage of the {PRODUCT_SHORT} _Business Service_ User Tasks API.
| rules-legacy-quarkus-example | A simple rule service to validate LoanApplication fact. An injectable KieRuntimeBuilder is generated, so you can create Drools v7 KieBase and KieSession out of it.
| rules-legacy-springboot-example | Same as above but for Spring Boot.
| rules-legacy-scesim-quarkus-example | A simple rule service to validate Hello fact and testing it using Scenario Simulation.
| rules-legacy-scesim-springboot-example | Same as above but for Spring Boot.
| rules-quarkus-helloworld | A minimal hello world rule service.
| ruleunit-event-driven-quarkus | This example demonstrates the capability of the Kogito Event-Driven Rules Add-on: to enable, when included as dependency of a simple service containing DRL files, to trigger evaluations of its queries and receive the corresponding results via specific CloudEvents.
| ruleunit-event-driven-springboot | Same as above but for Spring Boot.
| ruleunit-quarkus-example | A simple rule service to validate LoanApplication fact. REST endpoints are generated from query rules. You can insert LoanApplication facts and query a result via the REST endpoints. Rule resources are assembled as a RuleUnit.
| ruleunit-springboot-example | Same as above but for Spring Boot.
| standalone-editors-example | A collection of web pages showcasing how to embed {PRODUCT_SHORT} Standalone BPMN and DMN Editors in your frontend application.
