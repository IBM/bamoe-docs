include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

//tag::maven-setup[]
== Requirements
Set up your Maven environment, following these instructions for doing so xref:../installation/configure-maven.adoc[Installing â†’ BAMOE Maven repository].

== Project Setup Options
With the migration of the BAMOE product to Quarkus 3 you now have these options:

* Create a project manually
* Create a new project using the {CANVAS} Accelerator functionality. See xref:../tools/applying-accelerators.adoc[Using Accelerators].


== Manually creating a project for {PRODUCT_SHORT}
{PRODUCT_SHORT} uses a Maven project as a basis for the development of business automation artifacts. A Maven project can be created either using plugins or archetypes, for example using the following command:

[source,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-simple -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false
----

You can then update the `pom.xml` for the project with content from one of the following templates:

xref:../partials/rules-sample-pom.adoc[Sample Rules/Decision Application POM Template] a sample POM that describes a typical rules/decisions project dependencies and plugins.

xref:../partials/process-sample-pom.adoc[Sample Workflow Application POM Template] a sample POM that describes a typical Workflow project dependencies and plugins.

== Editing within VS Code

. Open the project in VS Code.
  Within the explorer are the basic artifacts created by maven:
.. `src/main/java`
.. `src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java`
.. `test/java/com/mycompany/app/AppTest.java`
.. and others.
. Install {DEV_TOOLS_VSCODE_MARKETPLACE_LINK}[*{DEV_TOOLS}*].
This gives you access to the visual editors for BPMN and DMN files.
It also allows you to create and edit testing scenarios for projects.

== Next Steps

Follow along with one of the examples in 15 minutes to complete setup and usage for the various use cases: xref:business-rule-microservice.html[business rules microservice], xref:orchestrating.html[orchestration], or xref:decision-microservice.html[decision microservice].

== Source Control
{CANVAS} is a standalone editor for BAMOE files, only works with git.
Any git based tools should continue to work with BAMOE projects (i.e. vscode, git cli, GitHub Desktop, etc.).
Add the code to git using a preferred tool, and push to a remote.
More information about xref:../installation/canvas.html[installing] and xref:../editing/intro-editing-testing.html[using {CANVAS}] can be found later in this documentation.
