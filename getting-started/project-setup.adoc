_Business Services_ are microservice Java applications built on top of Quarkus or Spring Boot, containing {PRODUCT_SHORT} runtime libraries and Business Automation assets such as Workflows (BPMN), Decisions (DMN), Rules (DRL), and spreadsheet Decision Tables (XLS or XLSX), following the structure and build conventions of Apache Maven.

Even though you can manually create everything from scratch, {PRODUCT_SHORT} provides an easier way to get started with pre-configured _Business Sevice_ projects–Accelerators.

There are currently two available Accelerators to choose from:

- **`Quarkus (DMN)`** - For _Business Services_ containing only Decisions, Rules, and spreadsheet Decision Tables
- **`Quarkus (Full)`** - For _Business Services_ containing stateful Workflows _(and Decisions, Rules, and spreadsheet Decision Tables as well, of course!)_

[NOTE]
====
Spring Boot is supported for Decisions, Rules, and spreadsheet Decision Tables services, but there's no Accelerator available for it yet. You can, however, get started with Spring Boot based on /// TODO
====

To use Accelerators, have three options:

a. Create Decisions and Workflows on {CANVAS} then apply an Accelerator.
b. Clone one of the Accelerators locally and start from there with {DEV_TOOLS}. 
c. (Advanced) Manually create a Java project and add dependencies to the _Business Service_ project's configuration file.

== a. Starting on {CANVAS}

Before starting, make sure your organization already provided you with a {CANVAS} installation or follow xref:../installation/canvas.adoc[Installing → {CANVAS}] to install it.

For starting a new _Business Service_ project on {CANVAS}, please refer to xref:../tools/applying-accelerators.adoc[{CANVAS} → Using Accelerators].

If you want to continue developing on {DEV_TOOLS} after starting on {CANVAS}, you can create a new Git repository in your Git provider of choice directly in {CANVAS} then clone it locally. Alternatively you can download your newly created _Business Sevice_ project from {CANVAS} as a .zip file and unpack it in your computer.

== b. Starting on {DEV_TOOLS}

Installing {DEV_TOOLS} is straighforward, an can be done directly in VS Code, simply follow xref:../installation/developer-tools-for-vscode.adoc[Installing → {DEV_TOOLS}].

Unlike {CANVAS}, {DEV_TOOLS} doesn't currently provide any commands to create a new _Business Service_ project automatically, but using Git in a Terminal window is easy enough, since {PRODUCT_SHORT} Accelerators are publicly hosted on IBM's GitHub at the https://github.com/IBM/bamoe-canvas-quarkus-accelerator template repository, following the steps below will get your started:

- Create a new folder in your preferred location and open it on VS Code.
- Open a new Terminal window (`Terminal` → `New Terminal`)
- Choose which Accelerator you want to start from and clone it:

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
git clone {ACCELERATOR_REPO_LINK} -b {BOM_VERSION}-quarkus-dmn my-business-service-project
----

or

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
git clone {ACCELERATOR_REPO_LINK} -b {BOM_VERSION}-quarkus-full my-business-service-project
----

- Your _Business Service_ project on {PRODUCT_SHORT}, based on your Accelerator of choice will be ready for you in the `my-business-service-project` folder.

- To unlink your newly created _Business Serivce_ project with the original Accelerator template repository, run

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
cd my-business-service-project && rm -rf .git && git init
----

- Your _Business Service_ project is now a fresh Git repository. You can create your first commit by running

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
git add . && git commit -m "First commit on my Business Service project"
----

- In the `src/main/resources` folder, your can create or move Workflows (`.bpmn`), Decisions (`.dmn`), Rules (`.drl`), spreadsheet Decision Tables (`.xls` or `.xlsx`), or Test Scenario (`.scesim`) files.

- You _Business Service_ project is now ready to be developed!

== c. (Advanced) Manually creating a Java project

If you're an experienced Java developer, you might have your own preferences when creating new projects. That's completely okay too, and you should be able to decide with {PRODUCT_SHORT} dependencies you need based on xref:../reference-guide/maven-repository-libraries.adoc[Reference → {MVN_REPO} libraries].

If you're planning on running Decisions, Rules, and/or spreadsheet Decision Tables on embedded Java mode using programmatic {PRODUCT_SHORT} Java APIs, please refer to xref:../editing/dmn-decisions-embedded-java-mode.adoc[Executing Decisions in embedded Java mode] or xref:../editing/drl-rules-embedded-java-mode.adoc[Executing Rules in embedded Java mode].

== Next steps

Now that you have a fully functional _Busines Service_ project on {PRODUCT_SHORT}, there are several things you might want to do:

- Update the README.md file with your _Business Service_ project's name and description.
- Check your {MVN_REPO} installation to be able to build your _Business Service_ project locally (xref:../installation/configure-maven.adoc[Installing → {MVN_REPO}]).
