//tag::maven-setup[]
First step: Install Apache Maven.
You can find instructions for doing so at https://maven.apache.org/install.html[the Apache Maven website].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Due to https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/31011, we recommend using the latest Apache Maven 3.8 version.
====

== Using Apache Maven to Setup the Project
Next, we'll create a project using the following steps:

. We're going to create the service in Quarkus with the Maven commands below, this will create a Quarkus project called `quick-kogito` that will be versioned `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` including the extensions `kogito-quarkus, dmn, resteasy-reactive-jackson, quarkus-smallrye-openapi, quarkus-smallrye-health` which will create a Quarkus DMN project with the openapi components to get the OpenAPI end points easily with health checks when deploying to OpenShift.

----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{QUARKUS_VERSION_SHORT}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.ibm.sample -DprojectArtifactId=quick-kogito \
    -DprojectVersion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -Dextensions=kogito-quarkus,dmn,resteasy-reactive-jackson,\
    quarkus-smallrye-openapi,quarkus-smallrye-health
----

. When you create this project you should get a bunch of Maven artifacts start to stream in your console that are being pulled and ultimately are left with a console message like the below:
+
[source,console]
----

//end::maven-setup[]

== Editing within VS Code

. Open the project in VS Code.
  From here we can see the workspace's contents and if we expand the contents of `/src/main` you will see the creation of several artifacts. 
  Within `java` you will have a `GreetingResource.java` and within `resources` you will have an `application.properties` and `pricing.dmn` file. 
  These are sample files that can be later modified or deleted.
+

. Install {VS_CODE_BUNDLE_LINK}[*{VS_CODE_BUNDLE}*].
  This gives you access to the visual editors for DMN and BPMN files.
  It also allows you to create and edit testing scenarios for project.
+
image::bamoe-vscode-marketplace.png[{VS_CODE_BUNDLE} within the marketplace]

. Let's first click the `pricing.dmn` file to open it. 
  When you do so you may be greeted with a message similar to `This diagram does not have layout information. Click 'Yes' to compute optimal layout, it takes time according to the diagram size. 
  Click 'No' to proceed without layout. 
  Please save the layout changes once diagram is opened.` - if so click `Yes` to automap the DMN locations.
+

. When the diagram opens you will see something similar to below, so we will start exploring it. 
  The DMN is made up of two inputs *Age* and *Previous incidents?*, which are used to make the decision, *Base price*.
+

. If you click *Age* and then click the *Properties* icon on the right, you will open a pane for the input.
+
image::properties-open.png[DMN Properties]

. Within this pane, you can see information about the input *Age*, this includes that it is a number and what the input name is. 
  More can be changed around this object, including changing the color of the node, font size, etc.
+
image::properties-expanded.png[DMN Properties Expanded]

. To view the Decision, click the square decision node and select the `Edit` button to enter the decision for *Base Price*.
+
image::open-decision.png[Edit DMN Decision]

. From here you will see the Decision Table that is associated with the Base Price decision. 
  From here you will see two (2) input columns (`Age` and `Previous Incidents`), as well as one output column (`Base price`) all with their types below them. 
  These types are controlled from the properties panel similarly to how they were opened when looking at `Age` a few steps ago. 
  This decision has 4 different rows that could fire, with a Hit Policy of `UNIQUE` signified by the **U** in the top left corner of the table. 
  A decision writer could make any comments they want to the table and have them saved towards the decision here.

== Create a GitHub repository for the project

One last thing we're going to do is to create a GitHub repository for this service, so you have somewhere to store our changes and also take advantage of building it into a cloud service running on OpenShift. 

. You can create a repository on https://github.com[GitHub]. 
  To do this login to your GitHub username (or create one if you don't have one!) and from your home page and click the green `New` icon near the top left of the page (or you can navigate directly to https://github.com/new[here])
+
image::new-repo.png[New Repo]

. Fill out the form with your values

    - **Repository Name**: quick-openshift-kogito
    - Select **Public** for now
    - Add a **Description** if you want
    - Click **Create Repository**
+
image::repo-form.png[Repo Form]

. Create some content to add to your repository.
  GitHub has some recommendations, if you would like to follow them.
+

. When this is done, you are finsihed with this section.
