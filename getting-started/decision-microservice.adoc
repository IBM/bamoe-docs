This lab introduces you to the deployment of an existing Decision Model and Notation (DMN) and the validation of its decisions.

- Explore an existing DMN file
- Test the DMN file
- Deploy the existing DMN project using {CANVAS}
- Test the deployed DMN

== Prerequisites
* xref:../installation/configure-maven.adoc[BAMOE Maven repository installed]
* xref:../installation/canvas.adoc[{CANVAS} installed]

== Examine the existing DMN Diagram

The following example describes an *insurance* price calculator based on an applicant's age and accident history. You can check the DMN model at {BAMOE_DOCS_EXAMPLES_DOCS_LINK}/dmn/insurance-pricing.dmn[GitHub].

This example consists of a simple DMN model, which is represented by the following diagram:

image::insurance-price-drd.png[Insurance Pricing Requirements Diagram, 600]

In this decision diagram, the applicant's age and accident history are the required inputs for the decision node "Insurance Total Price". This node has a simple Decision Table that can be checked below:

.DMN Decision Table
image::insurance-price-dt.png[Completed Decision Table,600]

The DMN Decision Table includes a `hit policy`, `inputs` columns, and `outputs` columns. In this example, the `hit policy` is `U`, which means `Unique`, therefore only one input rule should be matched per time. The `inputs` are `Age` and `had previous incidents` and the combination of both creates a rule. The result of this rule is the `outputs` column, which in this case is the "Insurance Total Price".

The conditions for the `Age` input are defined using the Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL).

== Import the DMN file into {CANVAS}

In this section, you will import the GitHub repository to {CANVAS} directly.

. Under **Import </> From URL** copy and paste the following link and click **Import**:
+
[source,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
{BAMOE_DOCS_EXAMPLES_DOCS_RAW_LINK}/dmn/insurance-pricing.dmn
----

+

. Once the project is imported, you will see the DMN Editor with the **insurance-pricing** DMN model displayed. If, instead of pointing to a particular DMN, you pointed to an entire project, any DMN/BPMN models associated with it would be able to be viewed/edited within {CANVAS}.
+

. You can then click the **Run** button to get this DMN running within the browser session itself.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you're not connected to {EXT_SERVICES}, a modal will open showing how to setup it in your local environment.
====
+
image::insurance-pricing-run.png[Run DMN]

. This will have a section of the browser turn into a form, and you can run the model right there by modifying the checkbox based on the boolean of `had previous incidents` and setting an `Age` based on the data type being a number.

== Deploy

In this section, you will use {CANVAS} to deploy your DMN model to a Kubernetes cluster.

=== Setup your credentials

. The first step is to connect to your Kubernetes cluster. To do it, click on (*1*) to open the "Connected accounts" modal, and click on "Connect to an account" (*2*) to setup a new account.
+

. To deploy a DMN model, {CANVAS} gives you the option to connect to a Kubernetes cluster or to OpenShift, which is a hybrid cloud platform offered by Red Hat. For this example, we'll use a local Kubernetes cluster, but in production, you may want to use your own internal Kubernetes. To continue, click on "Kubernetes" (*1*).

[NOTE]
====
If you're not connected to {EXT_SERVICES}, an additional modal will open showing how to setup it in your local environment. Click on "Setup" (*1*) and follow the instructions to continue with the Kubernetes login.

====

. In the "Connect to Kubernetes" modal, add your Kubernetes cluster information. If you want to create a local cluster, you can click on "Configure a new local Kubernetes cluster through the guided wizard" (*1*) and follow the instructions. To continue, click on "Connect" (*2*).

=== Deploy your DMN model

. After you've setup your credentials click on "Deploy" (*1*) and click on the DMN model name (*2*).
+
image::bamoe-canvas-deploy.png[Deploy]

. Your new deployment will appear in the "Dev Deployments" (*1*) dropdown. It will take about 30 seconds to be ready, and a green check will appear. Click on your deployment (*2*).
+
image::bamoe-canvas-deployments.png[Deployments]

. A new window will appear with the equivalent form of your DMN. You can share the deployed URL with everyone who has access to your cluster.
