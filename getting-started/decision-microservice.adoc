This lab introduces you to the deployment of an existing Decision Model and Notation (DMN) and the validation of its decisions.

- Explore an existing DMN file
- Test the DMN file
- Deploy the existing DMN project using {CANVAS}
- Test the deployed DMN

== Examine the Existing DMN Diagram

The following example describes an *insurance* price calculator based on an applicant's age and accident history. You can check the DMN model at https://github.com/timwuthenow/dmn-workshop-labs/blob/master/policy-price/insurance-pricing.dmn[GitHub].

This example brings a simple DMN model, which is represented by the following diagram:

image::insurance-price-drd.png[Insurance Pricing Requirements Diagram, 600]

In this decision diagram the applicant's age and accident history are the required inputs for the decision node "Insurance Total Price". This node has a simple decision table that can be checked below:

.DMN Decision Table

The DMN decision table includes a `hit policy`, `inputs` columns, and `outputs` columns. In this example, the `hit policy` is `U`, which means `Unique`, therefore only one input rule should be matched per time. The `inputs` are `Age` and `had previous incidents` and the combination of both creates a rule. The result of this rule is the `outputs` column, which in this case is the "Insurance Total Price".

The conditions for the `Age` input are defined using the Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL).

## Import the DMN File into {CANVAS}

In this section, you will import the GitHub repository to {CANVAS} directly.

. Under **Import </> From URL** copy and paste the following link and click **Import**:
+
----
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timwuthenow/dmn-workshop-labs/master/policy-price/insurance-pricing.dmn
----

+

. When the project is imported, you will see the DMN Editor with the **insurance-pricing** DMN model displayed. If you instead of pointing to a particular DMN, pointed to an entire project, any DMN/BPMN models associated with it would be able to viewed/edited within {CANVAS}.

. You can then click the **Run** button to get a local copy of this DMN running within the browser session itself.
+
image::insurance-pricing-run.png[Run DMN]

. This will have a section of the browser turn into a form and you can run the model right there. Modifying the checkbox based on the boolean of `had previous incidents` and set an `Age` based on the data type being a number.

. If you link your OpenShift login to the gear icon, you can even do a sample deployment of this as a service into OpenShift. For now this will conclude this section.
