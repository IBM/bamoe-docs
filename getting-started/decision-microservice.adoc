This lab introduces you to the deployment of an existing Decision Model and Notation (DMN) and validation of it's decisions.

- Explore an existing DMN file created using Business Central
- Deploy the existing DMN project to Decision Server
- Test the deployed DMN

== Examine Existing DMN Diagram

The following example describes an *insurance* price calculator based on an applicant's age and accident history. This is a simple decision process based on the following decision table:

.DMN Decision Table
image::insurance-price-dt.png[Completed Decision Table,600]

- The decision table was designed without using Business Central tools, but could be imported seemlesly due to the conformity with DMN specification.

- The DMN decision table includes a *hit policy*, *inputs*, and *outputs*.

- Unlike the drl based decision tables that can be created in Business Central, input and output names in DMN decision tables accept spaces.

- The conditions for the `Age` input is defined using the Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL).

The *decision* can also be represented by the following decision requirements diagram:

image::insurance-price-drd.png[Insurance Pricing Requirements Diagram, 600]

- In this decision requirements diagram, note that the applicant's age and accident history are the required inputs for the decision table "Insurance Total Price".

- The DMN component is currently stored in the https://github.com/timwuthenow/dmn-workshop-labs[DMN GitHub repository].

## Import the DMN File into KIE Sandbox

In this section, you will import the GitHub repository to KIE Sandbox directly.

. Navigate to the { product.sandbox }[{ sandbox.production }] and under **Import </> From URL** copy and paste the following link and click **Import**:
+
----
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timwuthenow/dmn-workshop-labs/master/policy-price/insurance-pricing.dmn
----

+
image::import-dmn.png[Import DMN]

. When the project is imported, you will see the DMN Editor with the **insurance-pricing** DMN model displayed. If you instead of pointing to a particular DMN, pointed to an entire project, any DMN/BPMN models associated with it would be able to viewed/edited within {{ product.sandbox }}.
+

. You can then click the **Run** button to get a local copy of this DMN running within the browser session itself.
+
image::dmn-run.png[Run DMN]

. This will have a section of the browser turn into a form and you can run the model right there. Modifying the checkbox based on the boolean of `had previous incidents` and set an `Age` based on the data type being a number.
+
[NOTE]
====
There is a known issue around the DMN Runner with forms that does not initially assume a non-checked box is false on the first successful execution.
To quickly get around this, check and uncheck the checkbox and move forward with your testing

. If you link your OpenShift login to the gear icon, you can even do a sample deployment of this as a service into OpenShift. For now this will conclude this section.

== Importing a DMN in Business Central

If you want to try this in Business Central, you can go through the following steps, but it is not required.

. From the GitHub web page, click **Clone or download** on the right and then select **Download ZIP**:

. Using your favorite file system navigation tool, locate the downloaded ZIP file and unzip it to a directory in your file system.

    - From this point forward, this location is referred to as `$PROJECT_HOME`.

. Log in to Business Central. You can use either `bamAdmin:ibmpam1!` or `pamadmin:pamadm1n` to do so or whatever login you have created on your instance.

. Create a project in Business Central called `policy-price`.

. In the empty project library view for the `policy-price` project, click **Import Asset**.
+

. In the **Create new Uploaded file** dialog, enter `insurance-pricing.dmn` in the **Uploaded file** field:
+
image::insurance-pricing-dmn-name.png[Filled out import,600px]

. Using the browse button at the far right of the field labeled **Please select a file to upload**, navigate with the file browser to the `$PROJECT_HOME` directory where the unzipped Git repository is located.

. Select the `$PROJECT_HOME\policy-price\insurance-pricing.dmn` file.

. Click **Ok** to import the DMN asset.

. The diagram will open and you will be able to see the DRD. Explore the diagram nodes to check the decision policies of this diagram. 
+
image::insurance-pricing-drd-added.png[Pricing DRD,600]

. Close the diagram. You should now be on the library view for the `policy-price` project.

. You should see the `insurance-pricing` asset is added to your project assets:
+
image::insurance-pricing-dmn-added.png[[Pricing imported,600]

. From the `policy-price` project's library view, click **Build**, then **Deploy** to deploy the project to the execution server.

. After receiving the build confirmation, navigate to the container deployment list by clicking the "**View deployment details**" link in the confirmation pop-up, or by selecting **Menu → Deploy → Execution Servers**.

. Verify that `policy-price_2.0.0` shows a *green* status:
