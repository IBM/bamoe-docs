= Orchestrating Decisions and Rules in 15 minutes 
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]
include::../styles/images.adoc[]

The following example is a Workflow scenario in {PRODUCT} that demonstrates how you can use Workflows to orchestrate your {PRODUCT} Business Decision Services. The example of a traffic violation project describes how to use Decisions within Workflows and how to integrate Decisions in an embedded way using Business Rule Tasks, which must be deployed with a Workflow in the same application.

NOTE: {PRODUCT} fully supports Straight-Through Processing (STP), where Workflows integrate with Decisions without any human intervention, without persistence, and without having to wait for timers to execute. For more {PRODUCT} examples that use Workflow capabilities, see the references below. Stateful Workflows is provided as a technology preview (xref:../workflow/overview.adoc[Overview of Stateful Workflows with Compact Architecture]) in versions {VERSION_910} and {VERSION_911}, and is fully supported on version {VERSION_920}.

The following diagram illustrates how Decisions are integrated with Workflows:

To view the complete project, see the xref:../getting-started/examples.adoc[`process-decisions-quarkus`] example application for Quarkus.

The example of a traffic violations project describes how to use Decisions within Workflows.

Those Decisions are then integrated using an embedded form using the Business Rule Tasks.

The tasks must be deployed with a Workflow in the same application.

In BAMOE, the Decisions can be expressed in different domains or assets, such as DMN and DRL. All the assets, including BPMN, DMN, and DRL must be placed in the resources folder.

When the example application is running, there also must be different running Workflows, such as a process using a Business Rule Task, containing the URL as `+http://localhost:8080/traffic+`.

== Traffic violations example for embedded method

The traffic violations project is based on the evaluation process of traffic violations. In the traffic violations example, first, the information of the driver is fetched, and based on the fetched information, it is determined whether the driver has a valid driving license using a RuleUnit in a DRL. After the validation of the driving license, the violation evaluation is executed, which is defined as a DMN Decision, and the output provides information on whether the driver is suspended or not.

=== Workflows in traffic violation example

In the traffic violations project, the interactions with the defined Decisions are executed using the Decision engine. Also, the information that is required to execute the Decision evaluation must be defined in the *Data Assignments* property of the Business Rule Task.

NOTE: The ID property of a process is used in the REST endpoint generation, which refers to the path that is used to interact with the process.

Also, the classes in the process are used to define the Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) that enable the interaction between the Workflow and Decisions. The process classes include `Violation`, `Driver`, `Fine`.

=== Rules in traffic violation example

The traffic violations process contains license validation as a Rule that is created using DRL. The license validation consists of rules that are evaluated to verify whether the license is expired or not. The result of the license validation is added to the driver variable. The rule units are declared in the `LicenseValidationService.drl` file and the rule unit data is added to the `LicenseValidationService` class.

Example `LicenseValidationService.drl` file:
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
unit LicenseValidationService

rule "Is driver license valid"
when
    $driver: /driver[licenseExpiration.after(currentTime)]
then
    $driver.setValidLicense(true);
end

rule "Is driver license expired"
when
    $driver: /driver[licenseExpiration.before(currentTime)]
then
    $driver.setValidLicense(false);
end

query "validation"
  $driver : /driver
end
----

Example `LicenseValidationService` class:
[source,java]
----
public class LicenseValidationService implements RuleUnitData {
    private SingletonStore<Driver> driver;

    public LicenseValidationService() {
        this(DataSource.createSingleton());
    }

    public LicenseValidationService(SingletonStore<Driver> driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }

    public void setDriver(SingletonStore<Driver> driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }

    public SingletonStore<Driver> getDriver() {
        return driver;
    }

    public Date getCurrentTime() {
        return new Date();
    }
}
----

After the license validation task, the traffic violations Workflow contains traffic violation as a Decision that is created using DMN. The traffic violation Decision verifies whether the driver is suspended or not based on the points in the driver's license.

The traffic violation Decision is declared in the `TrafficViolation.dmn` file.

.Example `TrafficViolation.dmn` file

=== Data mapping between Workflows and Decisions

To map the data between Workflows and Decisions, you can align all the attribute names in a Java class, which are used as process variables. If the names of the attributes contain spaces or the names of the attributes are not following Java conventions, then you can use https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] annotations. The Jackson annotations align the process variables with the data types of the DMN model. For example, in the traffic violations project, the `Violation` class is mapped with the `speedLimit` attribute using the `@JsonProperty` annotation. Therefore, the `speedLimit` attribute can be integrated with the `Violation` data type defined in the DMN model.

Violation class defined in the Traffic Violations example:
[source,java]
----
public class Violation {

    @JsonProperty("Code")
    private String code;

    @JsonProperty("Date")
    private Date date;

    @JsonProperty("Type")
    private String type;

    @JsonProperty("Speed Limit")
    private BigDecimal speedLimit;

    @JsonProperty("Actual Speed")
    private BigDecimal actualSpeed;

    //Getters / Setters
}
----

.Violation data type in DMN
image::violation-dmn-data-types.png[Image of violation data type in DMN]

When the driver information is fetched, an external call to a service task is performed to retrieve the driver information from the database. In this case, the service task implementation is performed using the `DriverService` class. In the Data Assignments, `driverId` is defined as an input variable and `driver` is defined as an output variable, consisting of the driver information.

Fetching the driver information leads to the license validation task, which represents the task of calling a DRL service.

.License validation task (DRL)
image::license-validation-drl-businessrule.png[Image of license validation task (DRL)]

The properties that are required to be set for the DRL service task include `Rule Language`, which must be set as `DRL` and the `Rule Flow Group`. You can set the value of `Rule Flow Group` using the following format:

[source,drl]
----
unit: + [the FQCN of the Rule Unit Data class] 
----

For example: 
[source,drl]
----
unit:org.kie.kogito.traffic.LicenseValidationService
----

In this case, the `driver` variable contains the license validation information.

Similar to the license validation task, the traffic violation task represents the task of calling a DMN service.

.Traffic violation task (DMN)
image::traffic-violation-dmn-businessrule.png[Image of traffic violation task (DMN)]

The properties that are required to be set for the DMN service task include `Rule Language`, which must be set as `DMN`. Also, you must set the values for `Namespace` and DMN Model Name` properties as defined in the DMN model, such as `TrafficViolation.dmn`. For example, you can set the following values:

- Rule Language: `DMN`
- Namespace: `+https://github.com/kiegroup/drools/kie-dmn/_A4BCA8B8-CF08-433F-93B2-A2598F19ECFF+`
- DMN Model Name: `Traffic Violation`

The input for the traffic violation task includes `Driver` and `Violation` variables, and the output includes `Suspended` and `Fine` in the Data Assignment property.

In both cases, whether the driver is suspended or not, the related information is logged in the console.

=== Running your project

You can start the Quarkus server with the following command in the project root:

[source,console]
----
mvn quarkus:dev
----

Then you can check the application Swagger UI at `+http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/#/+`
