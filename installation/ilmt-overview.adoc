You can maintain an up-to-date inventory of software assets that are installed in your infrastructure, gather information about your hardware, and ensure license compliance of your enterprise by using ILMT. You get to know the softwares that are existing in your system, and where or how it is used. By monitoring consumption of PVU, VPC, and RVU MAPC metrics by IBM® products under full and subcapacity licensing terms, you can understand the current license consumption. You can also predict the future license consumption, thus providing the means to optimize your license costs.
