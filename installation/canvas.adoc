//tag::canvas-description[]
{CANVAS} is a web application that provides authoring tools for Decisions and Workflows, directly in the browser. It enables different profiles of user (business automation developers and business policy managers) to create, edit and manage Decisions and Workflows, through editors and tool integrations such as Git for syncing repositories, and OpenShift and Kubernetes for deploying your files.
//end::canvas-description[]

It depends on two backend applications to provide full functionality:

* {EXT_SERVICES}: provides features like DMN Runner, static validation of DMN, BPMN models, and a proxy to communicate with OpenShift and Kubernetes clusters.
* {CORS_PROXY}: provides a proxy to allow {CANVAS} web app to communicate with Git providers, like github.com and bitbucket.org.

{CANVAS} and its two backend applications are available as container images.
These images are published to Quay.io and can be used to run containers locally or with any cloud provider.

* {CANVAS} → https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/canvas[https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/canvas] @ {IMAGE_VERSION}
* {EXT_SERVICES} → https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/extended-services[https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/extended-services] @ {IMAGE_VERSION}
* {CORS_PROXY} → https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/cors-proxy[https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/cors-proxy] @ {IMAGE_VERSION}

NOTE: All three image versions must be the same for deployment to work.

== Deploying {CANVAS} to OpenShift

If you have an OpenShift cluster and are logged in via the `oc` cli tool, follow these steps to deploy {CANVAS} and its dependencies.

NOTE: Labeling the resources is optional, but it will make organizing and identifying your deployed resources significantly easier.

. Define some variables that will be useful to name and label the resources created.
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
export APP_PART_OF=bamoe-canvas-app
export APP_NAME_EXTENDED_SERVICES=bamoe-extended-services
export APP_NAME_CORS_PROXY=bamoe-cors-proxy
export APP_NAME_BAMOE_CANVAS=bamoe-canvas
----
. Deploy {EXT_SERVICES} and label its resources
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc new-app quay.io/bamoe/extended-services:{IMAGE_VERSION} --name=$APP_NAME_EXTENDED_SERVICES
oc create route edge --service=$APP_NAME_EXTENDED_SERVICES
oc label services/$APP_NAME_EXTENDED_SERVICES app.kubernetes.io/part-of=$APP_PART_OF
oc label routes/$APP_NAME_EXTENDED_SERVICES app.kubernetes.io/part-of=$APP_PART_OF
oc label deployments/$APP_NAME_EXTENDED_SERVICES app.kubernetes.io/part-of=$APP_PART_OF
oc label deployments/$APP_NAME_EXTENDED_SERVICES app.openshift.io/runtime=golang
----
. Deploy {CORS_PROXY} and label its resources
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc new-app quay.io/bamoe/cors-proxy:{IMAGE_VERSION} --name=$APP_NAME_CORS_PROXY
oc create route edge --service=$APP_NAME_CORS_PROXY
oc label services/$APP_NAME_CORS_PROXY app.kubernetes.io/part-of=$APP_PART_OF
oc label routes/$APP_NAME_CORS_PROXY app.kubernetes.io/part-of=$APP_PART_OF
oc label deployments/$APP_NAME_CORS_PROXY app.kubernetes.io/part-of=$APP_PART_OF
oc label deployments/$APP_NAME_CORS_PROXY app.openshift.io/runtime=nodejs
----
. Finally, deploy the {CANVAS} image, setting the environment variables required to connect it to the {EXT_SERVICES} and {CORS_PROXY} backends.
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc new-app quay.io/bamoe/canvas:{IMAGE_VERSION} --name=$APP_NAME_BAMOE_CANVAS \
  -e KIE_SANDBOX_EXTENDED_SERVICES_URL=https://$(oc get route $APP_NAME_EXTENDED_SERVICES --output jsonpath={.spec.host}) \
  -e KIE_SANDBOX_CORS_PROXY_URL=https://$(oc get route $APP_NAME_CORS_PROXY --output jsonpath={.spec.host})
oc create route edge --service=$APP_NAME_BAMOE_CANVAS
oc label services/$APP_NAME_BAMOE_CANVAS app.kubernetes.io/part-of=$APP_PART_OF
oc label routes/$APP_NAME_BAMOE_CANVAS app.kubernetes.io/part-of=$APP_PART_OF
oc label deployments/$APP_NAME_BAMOE_CANVAS app.kubernetes.io/part-of=$APP_PART_OF
oc label deployments/$APP_NAME_BAMOE_CANVAS app.openshift.io/runtime=js

.The OpenShift topology after {CANVAS} deployment
image::bamoe-canvas-openshift-topology.png[OpenShift topology after {CANVAS} deployment]

Your {CANVAS} instance should be up and accessible via the route created in this last step. To get it, run this command:
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc get route $APP_NAME_BAMOE_CANVAS --output jsonpath={.spec.host}
----

NOTE: All services will be available via `https`, which means that if you're deploying them to a local OpenShift instance (i.e. via CRC), the {CANVAS} web app, the {EXT_SERVICES} and {CORS_PROXY} backends will all be using self-signed certificates, causing warnings in your browser. To fix this, access each URL individually and allow them in your browser.

== Installing and configuring {CANVAS} images manually via Docker

=== Configuring {EXT_SERVICES}

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run -p 21345:21345 -it quay.io/bamoe/extended-services:{IMAGE_VERSION}
# Add the -d flag to run in detached mode.
----
Access the API through port 21345, no additional configuration is necessary.


=== Configuring {CORS_PROXY}

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run -p 8090:8080 -it quay.io/bamoe/cors-proxy:{IMAGE_VERSION}
# Add the -d flag to run in detached mode.
----
The API is accessible via port 8090 (8080 is reserved for the bamoe-canvas image). No additional configuration is necessary.

=== Configuring {CANVAS}

This image must be run with two environment variables that will allow it to communicate with the two backend services:

`KIE_SANDBOX_EXTENDED_SERVICES_URL`:: E.g., https://extended-services.bamoe.company.com[https://extended-services.bamoe.my-company.com]

`KIE_SANDBOX_CORS_PROXY_URL`:: E.g., https://cors-proxy.bamoe.company.com[https://cors-proxy.bamoe.my-company.com]

If you are running locally, following the previous steps, use this command to start your {CANVAS} instance with the backend services:
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run -p 8080:8080 -it \
  -e KIE_SANDBOX_EXTENDED_SERVICES_URL=http://localhost:21345 \
  -e KIE_SANDBOX_CORS_PROXY_URL=http://localhost:8090 \
  quay.io/bamoe/canvas:{IMAGE_VERSION}
# Add the -d flag to run in detached mode.
----
The HTTP server is accessed via port 8080.

Several customization options are available. For more information on the configurations available via environment variables see https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/canvas?tab=info[https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/canvas?tab=info]


[NOTE]
====
Those addresses need to be accessible from the users' machines, as {CANVAS} will communicate with them directly from the user's browser.
Using internal IP/DNS services will not work.
Requests are made directly from the user's browser to both URLs configured above.
====

Another very important environment variable to consider when deploying {CANVAS} is `KIE_SANDBOX_DMN_DEV_DEPLOYMENT_BASE_IMAGE_URL`. It points to a container image that is used when creating a Dev Deployment for Decisions.

//only decisions? what about process?

By default, {CANVAS} is configured to fetch this image from https://quay.io/bamoe/canvas-dev-deployment-base:{BOM_VERSION_920}[https://quay.io/bamoe/canvas-dev-deployment-base:{BOM_VERSION_920}]


//what pre-configured image? Should we say, A pre-configured image is available from the community but is not part of BAMOE? Are we really saying that users should build their custom image from the base image rather than a pre-configured one? 

If you are installing {CANVAS} in an air-gapped environment, you will need to configure `KIE_SANDBOX_DMN_DEV_DEPLOYMENT_BASE_IMAGE_URL` to point to an image in a registry where the Cloud providers used by {CANVAS} users can access it.

For example, imagine a user is creating development deployments for Decisions on {CANVAS} to a local Kubernetes they have installed on their machine, for example Kind or Minikube.
This local Kubernetes instance needs to be able to download the image configured in `KIE_SANDBOX_DMN_DEV_DEPLOYMENT_BASE_IMAGE_URL`.
The same is true for remote Kubernetes and OpenShift instances that the users of {CANVAS} will configure to create their Dev Deployments for Decisions.

For other customization options of {CANVAS}, please refer to the https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/canvas?tab=info[description of the image].

== Other installation methods

{CANVAS} can also be deployed via xref:docker-compose.adoc[Docker Compose] or using xref:canvas-helm-charts.adoc[Helm Charts].

== Securing your Installation

It is recommended to have a secure protocol (HTTPS) available for the {CANVAS} installation as well as all services that {CANVAS} has access to, such as remote git repositories, or container orchestration like OpenShift. To enable that, please follow your Kubernetes distribution documentation on how to enable a secure protocol, ensuring that all access tokens have a token expiration policy.
