//tag::canvas-description[]
{CANVAS} is a web application that provides authoring tools for Decisions and Workflows, directly in the browser. It allows users to create, edit and manage Decisions and Workflows, by providing editors and other tools, such as Git integration for syncing repositories, OpenShift and Kubernetes integration for deploying your files, and much more.
//end::canvas-description[]

It depends on two backend applications to reach its full potential:

* Extended Services: This powers features like DMN Runner, static validation of DMN, BPMN models, and also provides a proxy to communicate with OpenShift and Kubernetes clusters.
* Git CORS Proxy: Provides a proxy to allow {CANVAS} web app to communicate with Git providers, like github.com and bitbucket.org.

{CANVAS} itself, as well as its two backend applications, are available as container images.
These images are published to Quay.io and can be used to run containers locally or in any cloud provider.

* Canvas → https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/canvas[https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/canvas?tab=tags] @ {VERSION}
* Extended Services → https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/extended-services?tab=tags[https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/extended-services?tab=tags] @ {VERSION}
* Git CORS Proxy → https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/git-cors-proxy[https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/git-cors-proxy?tab=tags] @ {VERSION}

NOTE: The *exact same version* needs to be used for a deployment with these three images to work.

== Deploying {CANVAS} to OpenShift

If you have a OpenShift cluster and are logged in via the `oc` cli tool, follow these steps to deploy {CANVAS} and its dependencies.

NOTE: Labeling the resources is optional, but it will make organizing and identifying your deployed resources much easier.

. Define some variables that will be useful to name and label the resources created.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]

export APP_PART_OF=bamoe-canvas-app
export APP_NAME_EXTENDED_SERVICES=bamoe-extended-services
export APP_NAME_GIT_CORS_PROXY=bamoe-git-cors-proxy

. Finally, deploy the {CANVAS} image, setting the environment variables required to connect it to the Extended Services and Git CORS Proxy backends.

.The OpenShift topology after {CANVAS} deployment
image::bamoe-canvas-openshift-topology.png[OpenShift topology after {CANVAS} deployment]

Your {CANVAS} instance should be up and accessible via the route created in this last step. To get it, run this command:
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc get route $APP_NAME_BAMOE_CANVAS --output jsonpath={.spec.host}
----

NOTE: All services will be available via `https`, which means that if you're deploying them to a local OpenShift instance (i.e. via CRC), the {CANVAS} web app, the Extended Services and Git CORS Proxy backends will all be using self-signed certificates, causing warnings in your browser. To fix this, access each URL individually and allow them in your browser.

== Installing and configuring {CANVAS} images manually via Docker

=== Configuring Extended Services

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run -p 21345:21345 -it quay.io/bamoe/extended-services:{VERSION}
# Add the -d flag to run in detached mode.
----
Access the API through port 21345, no additional configuration is necessary.


=== Configuring Git CORS Proxy

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run -p 8090:8080 -it quay.io/bamoe/git-cors-proxy:{VERSION}
# Add the -d flag to run in detached mode.
----
The API is accessible via port 8090 (8080 is reserved for the bamoe-canvas image), no additional configuration is necessary.

=== Configuring Canvas

In particular, this image needs to be run with two environment variables that will allow it to communicate with its backend services:

`KIE_SANDBOX_EXTENDED_SERVICES_URL`:: E.g., https://extended-services.bamoe.company.com[https://extended-services.bamoe.my-company.com]

`KIE_SANDBOX_GIT_CORS_PROXY_URL`:: E.g., https://git-cors-proxy.bamoe.company.com[https://git-cors-proxy.bamoe.my-company.com]

If you're running locally, following the previous steps, use this command to start you {CANVAS} instance with the backend services:
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run -p 8080:8080 -it \
  -e KIE_SANDBOX_EXTENDED_SERVICES_URL=http://localhost:21345 \
  -e KIE_SANDBOX_GIT_CORS_PROXY_URL=http://localhost:8090 \
  quay.io/bamoe/canvas:{VERSION}
# Add the -d flag to run in detached mode.
----
The HTTP server is accessed via port 8080.

Several customization options are available. Check more configurations available via environment variables here: https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/canvas?tab=info[https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/canvas?tab=info]


[NOTE]
====
Those addresses need to be accessible from the users' machines, as {CANVAS} will communicate with them directly from the user's browser.
Using internal IP/DNS services will not work.
Requests are made directly from the user's browser to both URLs configured above.
====

Another very important environment variable to consider when deploying {CANVAS} is `KIE_SANDBOX_DMN_DEV_DEPLOYMENT_BASE_IMAGE_URL`. 

This environment variable points to a container image that is used when creating a Dev deployment for Decisions.

By default, {CANVAS} is configured to fetch this image from https://quay.io/repository/kie-tools/dmn-dev-deployment-base-image[https://quay.io/repository/kie-tools/dmn-dev-deployment-base-image] @ {KIE_TOOLS_COMMUNITY_VERSION}

[IMPORTANT]
====
The pre-configured image is NOT part of BAMOE, and comes from the open-source KIE community. People installing {CANVAS} must change `KIE_SANDBOX_DMN_DEV_DEPLOYMENT_BASE_IMAGE_URL` to make sure the used image meets their requirements. For a reference on how to build your own image that is compatible with {CANVAS} Dev deployments, go to the KIE community's source code for `dmn-dev-deployment-base-image` at https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-tools/tree/{KIE_TOOLS_COMMUNITY_VERSION}/packages/dmn-dev-deployment-base-image
====

If you're installing {CANVAS} to an air-gapped environment, you're going to need to configure `KIE_SANDBOX_DMN_DEV_DEPLOYMENT_BASE_IMAGE_URL` to point to an image in a registry where the Cloud providers used by {CANVAS} users can access.

For example, imagine a user is creating Dev deployments for Decisions on {CANVAS} to a local Kubernetes they have installed on their machine, for example Kind or Minikube.
This local Kubernetes instance needs to be able to download the image configured in `KIE_SANDBOX_DMN_DEV_DEPLOYMENT_BASE_IMAGE_URL`.
The same is true for remote Kubernetes and OpenShift instances that the users of {CANVAS} will configure to create their Dev deployments for Decisions.

For other customization options of {CANVAS}, refer to the image's https://quay.io/repository/bamoe/canvas?tab=info[description].

== Other installation methods

{CANVAS} can also be deployed via Docker Compose, check out our tutorial here: xref:docker-compose.adoc[Docker Compose].

== Securing your Installation

It's highly recommended to have a secure protocol (HTTPS) available for the {CANVAS} installation. To enable that, follow your Kubernetes distribution documentation on how to enable it.

It's also recommended for all services that {CANVAS} will have access to, like remote git repositories or container orchestration like OpenShift, to have all access tokens have a token expiration policy.
