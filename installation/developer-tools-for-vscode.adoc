It is available at the Visual Studio Marketplace, as {DEV_TOOLS_VSCODE_MARKETPLACE_LINK}[*{DEV_TOOLS}*].

We recommend turning off the "Auto Update" option to let you be in control of when to upgrade. The visual Editors included in {DEV_TOOLS} will auto-update files to their newest version, which may make them incompatible with the BAMOE version you are using in your _Business Services_.

More information on using the extensions can be found in xref:../tools/developer-tools-for-vscode.adoc[Available features â†’ {DEV_TOOLS}].
