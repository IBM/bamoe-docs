## Data Audit subsystem

This is the implementation of the Kogito Audit subystem. By using the subsystem, you can store events issued by:
- Process engine
- User task
- Job service

Following are the main features:

- runs as colocated services with quarkus and springboot
- module to write your own subsystem
- graphql modules to query data
- extension points to develop new storage easily
- extension points to develop new queries extending graphql definitions

## Design of the Data Audit

The system contains several modules and common modules to redistribute responsabilities.

![Data Audit Architecture](../images/design.png "Data Audit Architecture")

Data Audit Common: Provides the common framework to create implementations.

Data Audit «Quarkus»: Provides the wiring to use Data Audit with Quarkus as colocated service (deployment).

Data Audit «SpringBoot»: Provides the wiring to use Data Audit with SpringBoot as colocated service (deployment).

Implementation examples:

Data Audit JPA Common: Provides the common extension by not depending on the runtime.

Data Audit JPA «Quarkus»: Provides the wiring between the specific implementation and Quarkus System.

Data Audit JPA «SpringBoot»: Provides the wiring between the specific implementation and Springboot colocated system.


## Queries

You can retrieve the information from the data audit by using GraphQL. You can abstract how the information is retrieved and allow different needs depending on the user.

The Path is `${HOST}/data-audit/q` for sending GraphQL queries.

### Example

Execute a registered query, for example,  `GetAllProcessInstancesState` with a definition of data fields that should be returned:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -s -X POST http://${HOST}/data-audit/q/ -d '
{
    "query": "{GetAllProcessInstancesState {eventId, processInstanceId, eventType, eventDate}}"
}'|jq
```

To retrieve the GraphQL schema definition by  including a list of all registered queries, run a GET command to the `${HOST}/data-audit/r` endpoint. This endpoint can also be used to register new queries.

### Example

Register a new query with a complex data type:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -s -X POST http://${HOST}/data-audit/r/ -d '
{
    "identifier" : "tests",
    "graphQLDefinition" : "type EventTest { jobId : String, processInstanceId: String} type Query { tests (pagination: Pagination) : [ EventTest ] } ",
    "query" : "SELECT o.job_id, o.process_instance_id FROM job_execution_log o"
}'
```

After the query is registered, the new query can be executed similar to the pre-registered query by using the `${HOST}/data-audit/q` endpoint:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -s -X POST http://${HOST}/data-audit/q/ -d '
{
    "query": "{tests {jobId, processInstanceId}}"
}'|jq
```

## JPA implementation

You can store the events in a database by using the jpa implementation. The only requirement is that you need to setup the datasource.

## Extension Points

There are two different extensions. One belongs to the runtime to wire things and the other that  does not depends on the runtime.
 

Extension points depending on the runtime is:
org.kie.kogito.app.audit.spi.

DataAuditContextFactory: Use it to create the context needed by a particular implementation.

Extension points not depending on the runtime is:
org.kie.kogito.app.audit.spi.

DataAuditStore: Responsible to store the data in certain way in
org.kie.kogito.app.audit.spi.

GraphQLSchemaQuery<T>: Responsible to execute a GraphQL query,
org.kie.kogito.app.audit.spi.

GraphQLSchemaQueryProvider: By using this query, the subsystem can identify additional queries provided by the end user.


## Using the query in Quarkus/Springboot

You need to add two different dependencies to your project (collocated service)

	<dependency>
	    <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
	    <artifactId>kogito-addons-data-audit-<runtime></artifactId>
	    <version>${version}</version>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
	    <artifactId>kogito-addons-data-audit-jpa-<runtime></artifactId>
	    <version>${version}</version>
	</dependency>


The first dependency is related to how you want to deploy it such as collocated or embedded service.
The second dependency is related to which implementation you want to use.

Each implementation might require additional dependencies. For using JPA implementation you might require driver.

	<dependency>
	    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
	    <artifactId>quarkus-jdbc-h2</artifactId>
	</dependency>

No additional configuration is required besides the default datasource use by the application already.
