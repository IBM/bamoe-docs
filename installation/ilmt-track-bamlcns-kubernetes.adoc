== Prerequisites

Follow the https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/foundational-services/3.23?topic=software-installing-license-service-stand-alone[procedure]  to install the License Service for stand-alone software.

NOTE: Though the link directs you to the standalone version of IBM License Service, the documentation is hosted by IBM Cloud Pak in the foundational component. It is also important to note that the BAMOE is not part of IBM Cloud Pak.

oc patch deployment <bamoe-canvas_deployment_name> -p \
  '{"spec": {"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"productID":"46b14c7f2f894218a7879b3f6416024f", "productName": "IBM Decision Manager Open Edition", "productMetric": "VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR_CORE", "productChargedContainers": "All"}}}} }'
