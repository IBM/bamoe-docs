= Migrating from Business Central to IBM {DEV_TOOLS}

== Overview

Business Central was a web-based platform for authoring business automation assets such as data objects, rules, processes, cases, and planning entities.
It included capabilities for monitoring, administration, and management of business automation assets.
With the release of both IBM {DEV_TOOLS} and IBM {CANVAS} most of the asset management capabilities were replaced or sometimes take a different approach altogether. 
This section describes 'the' migration of business 
assets 'that are' created in Business Central so that they can be maintained by developers by using either {DEV_TOOLS} or {CANVAS} or both.

== Prerequisites

The following tools are required to migrate from Business Central to {DEV_TOOLS}.
It is assumed that you have a current version of Business Central running to export certain types of assets to their supported form in {PRODUCT_SHORT}:

== Business Automation Assets in Businss Central

The following types of business automation assets were available within Business Central with a focus on the the assets are no longer supported in version {VERSION}.
This is to indicate how to manage assets in absence of Business Central.

[NOTE]
====
At this time `Test Scenarios` are not directly supported in {CANVAS}, as it has its own test scenario asset.
There will be comptability between test scenarios included in a future release of {PRODUCT}.

== Migration of Deprecated Assets

While it is the case that all guided editors have been deprecated in {PRODUCT} v{VERSION}, that does not mean that you will loose all your effort into building those 
assets.
It is possible to convert certain guided assets to their non-guided and supported form.
The following table indicates the mapping from guided to non-guided form:

.Business Central Guided Asset Types
[cols="2,3,3"]
|===
| Asset Name & Type | Description | v9 Non-Guided Form
| Guided Decision Table (.gdst) | Guided Decisison Table | **Export** from BC to Decision Table Spreadsheet (.xls)
| Guided Rule (.rdrl) | Technical Rule (.drl) | **Copy** source from BC to new Technical Rule (.drl) file
|===

== How to **Copy** the asset Source from Business Central

It is important to keep in mind that all guided assets are Drools Rule Language (.drl) files under the cover.
In most situations a guided asset can be refactored into a non-guided asset by simply copying the source from the source tab in Business Central into a file with the file extension of `.drl`.
With that in mind, here is an example of how to accomplish this, using a `Guided Rule` as an example:

.Example Guided Rule in Business Central
image::bc-example-guided-rule.png[Example Guided Rule in Business Central]

As you can see this is the default tab `(Model)` in Business Central's guided rule editor.
If you simply navigate over to the `Source` tab, you will quickly see that the guided rule is simply a editor view on top of a standard `technical rule` written using `Drools Rule Language (DLR)`, as in the following example:

.Example Guided Rule in Business Central (Source Tab)
image::bc-example-guided-rule-source.png[Example Guided Rule in Business Central]

In order to turn this rule into non-guided form so that it can be modified by {DEV_TOOLS}, follow these steps:

. Copy the contents of the rule in the `Source` tab
. Create a new text file and paste the contents from the `Source` tab into the new file
. Give this file an extenssion of `.drl`
. Add this file to the `src/main/resources` folder of your Maven project.

[NOTE]
====
Some guided rules when authored with the guided rule editor create additional rule attributes which may or may not continue to be relevant to your rule execution pattern.
Examples of these types of attriutes are `salience`, `dialect`, `no-loop`, & `lock-on-active`.  While these attributes play a unique role in guided rules they may impact the overall behavior of your ruleset.
====

At this point you are free to modify the new `technical rule` to your liking, such as updating to use `rule units`, using `OOPATH syntax` vs `mvel`, etc. 

== How to **Export** the asset from Business Central

Guided Decision Tables are a wizard-led alternative to uploaded decision table spreadsheets for defining business rules in a tabular format.
With guided decision tables, you are led by a UI-based wizard in Business Central that helps you define rule attributes, metadata, conditions, and actions based on specified data objects in your project.
After you create your guided decision tables, the rules you defined are compiled into Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules as with all other rule assets.

Since the `Guided Decision Table` editor in Business Central is deprecated, users will need to export guided decision tables to Excel format.
With that in mind, here is an example of how to accmoplish this, using a `Guided Decision Table` as an example:

.Example Guided Decision Table in Business Central
image::bc-example-guided-dt.png[Example Guided Decision Table in Business Central]

In order to turn this decision table into non-guided form so that it can be modified by {DEV_TOOLS}, follow these steps:

. Convert to XLS using the Business Central option on the button bar
. Select the newly created `.xls` file in the Project Explorer
. Select one of the `Download` options on the button bar
. Add this file to the `src/main/resources` folder of your Maven project.

As you can see in from this diagram, this is the default tab `(Model)` in Business Central's guided decision table editor.
If you navigate over to the `Source` tab, you will quickly see that the guided decision table is simply a editor view on top of a standard `technical rule` written using `Drools Rule Language (DLR)`, as in the following example:

.Example Guided Decision Table in Business Central (Source Tab)
image::bc-example-guided-dt-source.png[Example Guided Decision Table in Business Central]

At this point the user has a choice, they can either take the same approach as with guided rules or they can export this table to Excel format, simply by clicking a button _(**Convert to XLS**)_, as in the following example:

.Exporting a Guided Decision Table in Business Central
image::bc-example-guided-dt-export.png[Exporting a Guided Decision Table in Business Central]

Once the table has been converted to XLS format, the new file is added to the Business Central `Project Explorer` view:

.Converted Guided Decision Table in Business Central
image::bc-example-guided-dt-export-navigator.png[Converting a Guided Decision Table in Business Central]

From there it is simply a matter of selecting the converted file and pressing one of the `Download` buttons in Business Central, which will download the converted spreadsheet file to your local machine so the file can be added to your project's `src/main/resources` folder of your Maven project.

.Converted Guided Decision Table in Business Central
image::bc-example-guided-dt-export-download.png[Exporting a Guided Decision Table in Business Central]

[NOTE]
====
Guided decision tables are, under the covers, a collection of technical rules generated using .DRL syntax.
The number of rows in a decision table will equal the number of individual technical rules generated, one for each row.
Rules make use of `salience` in order to orchestrate the execution of each `row` of the decision table.
It is possible replace a decision table directly with technical rules vs exporting to Excel format, provided you follow the pattern that the rules were generated to.
