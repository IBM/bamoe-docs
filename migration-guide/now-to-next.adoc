= Migrating to {PRODUCT_LONG} v{PRODUCT_VERSION}

{PRODUCT} v {VERSION} is optimized for a hybrid cloud environment and adapts to your domain and tooling needs.
The core objective of {PRODUCT_SHORT} is to help you mold a set of business processes and decisions into your own domain-specific cloud-native set of services.

== Overview

This section describes migration of existing applications to version {PRODUCT_VERSION} of {PRODUCT_LONG}.

== Prerequisites

The following tools are required to migrate to {PRODUCT_SHORT} v{VERSION}:

include::../partials/prerequisites.adoc[]

== Procedure

While it is possible to migrate an existing **Knowledge Jar (KJAR)** project, it is recommended that you start your project from scratch, since the Maven configuration for {PRODUCT_SHORT} v {VERSION} is significantly different from that of {PRODUCT_SHORT} v {VERSION_OLD} or {RH_DM} Version 7.
Note that the process is simple, as it is driven by Maven, and Quarkus specifically.  

The first step is to generate a new Maven project so that there is a place to migrate your existing business automation assets into the new {PRODUCT_SHORT} architecture.
There are several ways to create Maven projects, however the approach is to use a published Maven plugin.
Follow the procedure to ensure that the Maven project is setup properly:   

=== Step 1: Update Maven Configuration

{MAVEN_SITE_URL_BASE}[Apache Maven] is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
{PRODUCT_LONG} depends on Maven to build various types of deployable artifacts, such as decision service applications.
For a quick start, see the {MAVEN_SITE_URL_GETTING_STARTED}[Maven Quick Start Guide].  

Since {PRODUCT_SHORT} v{VERSION} is based on Quarkus 2, the easiest route is to use the Quarkus Maven Plugin and adjust some of the details in the generated project to align it with {PRODUCT_SHORT} dependencies and plugins.
You can read all about **Quarkus and Maven** https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling[here].

==== Update Maven Settings

The `settings.xml` file is a repository for customizing Mavenâ€™s global operational parameters, distinguishing itself from `pom.xml` by its non-association with particular projects.
This file includes configurations such as the location of the local repository, alternative sources for remote repositories, and inputting credentials, among others.

There are two directories for the storage of the settings.xml file:

- Maven Installation Directory: Found at ${Maven.home}/conf/settings.xml, this location reflects the settings applied universally across all Maven projects on the system.
- User-Specific Configuration: Located at ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml, this directory allows for the storage of user-specific Maven settings.

Users can adjust their Maven environment to better suit their development needs by using these configurations.

[NOTE]
====
The first `settings.xml` is also referred to as `global settings`, and the second is referenced as user settings.
Both are combined with users taking precedence.
====

[TIP] 
====
If you need to create user-specific settings from scratch, it's easiest to copy the global settings from your Maven installation to your *_${user.home}/.m2_* directory.
Maven's default *_settings.xml_* is a template with comments and examples so you can quickly tweak it to match your needs.
_If you are looking to learn more about how to manage your various Maven settings, see https://maven.apache.org/settings.html[Maven Settings Reference]._
====

With the knowledge from {PRODUCT} Version 8 or Red Hat's Version 7, you might be familiar with product dependencies hosted by https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/com/redhat/ba/[Red Hat's Maven repository].
However, this is not required anymore as the product dependencies are hosted by https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=bamoe[Maven Central].
There is no need to include an additional repository in `pom.xml` or `settings.xml`.

=== Step 2: Generate a New Maven Project using Apache Maven

Now that we have Maven properly configured, we can move onto the next step, which is to generate a new Maven project:

[start=1]
. In a terminal window, create a new local folder for the new Maven project, for example, `/Users/developer`, and naviate to the folder.

. Create the project by using Quarkus and the following Maven commands. 
This creates a Quarkus project called `my-sample-decision-service`, which is versioned `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`, including the extensions `kogito-quarkus, dmn, resteasy-reactive-jackson, quarkus-smallrye-openapi, quarkus-smallrye-health`.
This also creates a Quarkus DMN project with the OpenAPI components to get the OpenAPI end points easily with health checks when deploying to Kubernetes:

+
[source,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:2.16.7.Final:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.ibm.bamoe.samples \
    -DprojectArtifactId=my-sample-decision-service \
    -DprojectVersion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -DplatformGroupId=io.quarkus.platform \
    -DplatformArtifactId=quarkus-bom \
    -DplatformVersion={QUARKUS_VERSION_SHORT} \
    -Dextensions=kogito-quarkus,dmn,resteasy-reactive-jackson,quarkus-smallrye-openapi,quarkus-smallrye-health
----

[NOTE]
====
As you can see from the Maven command, there are a number of possible `extensions` that can be added to the project for the specific functionality. 
You can find more information on available extensions at the following locations:  https://quarkus.io/extensions/[Quarkus Extensions], and https://quarkus.io/extensions/?search-regex=kogito[Kogito Extensions].
====

When you create this project, you might get a bunch of Maven artifacts start to stream in your console that are being pulled and ultimately are left with a console message like the following:

[source,console]
----
[INFO]
[INFO] ========================================================================================
[INFO] Your new application has been created in /Users/developer/my-sample-decision-service
[INFO] Navigate into this directory and launch your application with mvn quarkus:dev
[INFO] Your application will be accessible on http://localhost:8080
[INFO] ========================================================================================

[INFO] Finished at: 2022-09-27T10:22:31-04:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

[start=3]
.  Add the following `properties` to the `pom.xml` file by using the row numbers as a guide.
This specifies the Maven coordinates for the {PRODUCT_SHORT} Maven Bill-of-Materials (BOM), which manages all of the associated depenency versions to a specific {PRODUCT_SHORT} release:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
17        <surefire-plugin.version>{SUREFIRE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}</surefire-plugin.version>
18  +++   <kogito.bom.group-id>com.ibm.bamoe</kogito.bom.group-id>
19  +++   <kogito.bom.artifact-id>bamoe-bom</kogito.bom.artifact-id>
20  +++   <kogito.bom.version>{BOM_VERSION}</kogito.bom.version>
21      </properties>
----

[start=4]
. Replace lines 29-31, which is essentially adding the `bamoe-bom` to the list of imported dependencies:

+
[source,xml]
----
28      <dependency>
29  ---   <groupId>${quarkus.platform.group-id}</groupId>
30  ---   <artifactId>quarkus-kogito-bom</artifactId>
31  ---   <version>${quarkus.platform.version}</version>
29  +++   <groupId>${kogito.bom.group-id}</groupId>
30  +++   <artifactId>${kogito.bom.artifact-id}</artifactId>
31  +++   <version>${kogito.bom.version}</version>
32        <type>pom</type>
33        <scope>import</scope>
34      </dependency>
----
+
A bill of materials (BOM) is a list of parts or components that are required to build a product.
BOMs are ordinary `pom.xml` files that contain no source code and the only purpose is to declare their bundled modules.

.Always use the Maven Bill-of-Materials (BOM)
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended to use bill of materials (BOM) to manage project dependencies, as it simplifies the dependency management by organizing a group of dependencies under a single version. 

It must be noted that the use of Maven bill-of-materials (BOM) does not add any dependencies to the project.
They are only the definitions that help resolve (versions) the dependencies (and transient dependencies).
====    

A bill of materails (BOM) can be added to an existing POM file by adding it to the **_dependencyManagement_** section as a dependency with a pom type:

include::../partials/maven-bom-now.adoc[]

When a bill of materials (BOM) is used, it is not necessary to specify the dependency's version, as that appears from the BOM, so your dependencies end up like the following:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
        <artifactId>drools-compiler</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

[NOTE]
====
During the course of your Maven dependency update, if you encounter any dependencies that are not included in the bill of materials (BOM), then use the Maven Library Version noted in the following table:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
        <artifactId>drools-compiler</artifactId>
        <version>{BOM_VERSION_OLD}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

You must also report to IBM that a dependency is missing so that the problem can be resolved in the next release.
====

The following table is useful in determining which community release is bound to the section details of the mapping of https://www.kie.org/[KIE Community] releases to the current {PRODUCT_LONG} enterprise release.

[id=mapping-next]
include::../partials/version-mapping-next.adoc[]

[start=5]
. Add the `IBM ILMT Compliance Library` to the `pom.xml`  _(this is required to report on subscription entitlement usage within the system)_:
+
[source,xml]
----
77  +++   <dependency>
78  +++     <groupId>com.ibm.bamoe</groupId>
79  +++     <artifactId>bamoe-ilmt-compliance-quarkus-dmmoe</artifactId>
80  +++   </dependency>
81      </dependencies>
----

[NOTE]
====
You might notice that the newly added Maven dependency includes the `groupId` and `artifactId` portions of the Maven coordinates but does not specify a `version` tag.
This is due to importing the `bamoe-bom` into the project, where the various dependency versions are managed.
====

[start=6]
. Build the project in the root folder:
+
[source,console]
----
mvn clean package
----
+
You might get Maven streaming text once again, and at the end of it you must have:
+
[source,console]
----
[INFO] Analysing decision tables in DMN Model 'pricing' ...

----

[NOTE]
====
The choice of extensions determines the imported behavior of the project including adding sample models or testing related code.
For example, by adding the 'dmn' extension, it not only adds the proper dependencies but also adds a sample `.dmn` model to the project, which acts as a template to work on.
====

After the project is generated, you must see a project structure in VS Code, similar to the following diagram:

.Example Maven Project in VS Code
image::maven-project.png[Example Maven Project in VS Code]

As you can see from the figure, a Maven compliant project is generated, including all of the standard folders typically found in a Maven project.
The most significant folder is the `resources` folder, which is where new or migrated business automation asset files must be stored.
Examples of supported business automation assets are:

- Decision Model & Notation (DMN) Models (.dmn)
- Drools Rule Language (DLR) Files (.drl)
- Business Process Modeling & Notation (BPMN) Models (.bpmn)
- Excel Decision Tables (XLS) Files (.xls)
- Standard Property Files (.properties)
- Test Scenario Files (.scesim)

[NOTE]
====
The proper folder for unit test files is `src/test/resources`, as this is a testing resource.
====

=== Step 3: Add Business Automation Assets

If your project is migrated from a previous version of the product, you can add the business automation files from the previous project to the `src/main/resources` folder of the new project by copying the file(s).
If you need to create a new file, use VS Code's `File : New File` option, making sure to specify the file extension to associate the new file with the appropriate editor.

=== Step 4: Compile, Build, Test, Deploy

You can follow the standard guidance on how to maintain your decision service project including how to build using Maven and deploy to your target Kubernetes-based environment.
This includes not only creating and publishing the new project to an enterprise GIT repository and configuring your CI/CD pipeline to pull from GIT, perform a Maven build/test/deploy, etc.

[NOTE]
====
After completing the migration of the project, you might want to consider migrating your technical rules to use new language features, such as `rule units` or `OOPATH syntax`.
Refer to xref:drl.html[Drools Rule Language Migration] for migration to the latest version of Drools Rule Language (DLR).
