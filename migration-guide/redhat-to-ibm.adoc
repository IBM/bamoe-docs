= Migrating from Red Hat to {PRODUCT_LONG}

The offerings formally known as {RH_PAM} / {RH_DM} were transitioned to IBM in 2022, where the product was re-branded as {PRODUCT_LONG}.

== Overview

{PRODUCT} v{VERSION_80} provides a seemless upgrade path for customers and workloads formally leveraging the Red Hat offerings.
By remaining a functionally equivalent product to the Red Hat offering, customers can easily migrate from the former Red Hat offering once they have purchased an IBM subscription for {PRODUCT}.
This section provides guidance on how to migrate from the former Red Hat offerings of {RH_PAM} / {RH_DM} to {PRODUCT} v{VERSION_80}.
It is recommended that you follow this migration path before attempting to migrate to the next generation of the product known as {PRODUCT} version {VERSION_910}.  

== Prerequisites

If your current application is based on the legacy product known as {RH_BPMS} you must first bring your installation up to the latest release of {RH_PAM} / {RH_DM} v7 before performing any migration to {PRODUCT}.
Please refer to the existing https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_process_automation_manager/7.0/html/migrating_from_red_hat_jboss_bpm_suite_6.4_to_red_hat_process_automation_manager_7.0/index[Red Hat Documentation] in order to facilitate migrating from {RH_BPMS} to {RH_PAM}/{RH_DM} v7.x.
From there you are free to migrate to any release of {PRODUCT}.

The following tools are required to migrate to {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_80}:

include::../partials/prerequisites.adoc[]

== Procedure

The following steps are typically involved with migrating from {RH_PAM} / {RH_DM} to {PRODUCT_LONG}:

=== Step 1: Download Product Archives

The first step in migration is to download the product archives from either {PRODUCT_FIX_CENTRAL_PAGE}[IBM Fix Central] _(which requires an active support subscription to {PRODUCT})_ or via the {DEV_PROGRAM_PAGE}[IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions Developer Program] _(subject to its terms)_.
Download the files _(replace with the most current version)_ based on your requirement.
The following list shows the most common files but you can select other files according to your environment.


.{PRODUCT_SHORT} Product Archives
image::bamoe-downloads-7-8.png[Product Archives]

The following archives are typically used in migrating to {PRODUCT_SHORT}:

.Common Product Archives
|===
| Product Archive | Description

| ILMT_for_IBAMOE_**{VERSION**}.zip   
| This archive is used by IBM ILMT in order to measure the usage deployed in an environment of the product

|===
[NOTE]
====

In the displayed table, you must replace **VERSION** with the version of {PRODUCT_SHORT} you are migrating to, such as {VERSION_8_LATEST}.
====

_Now that we have those files we can start to migrate our environment._

=== Step 2: Update Maven Configuration

{MAVEN_SITE_URL_BASE}[Apache Maven] is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
{PRODUCT_LONG} relies on Maven in order to build various types of deployable artifacts, such as decision service applications.
For a quick start see the {MAVEN_SITE_URL_GETTING_STARTED}[Maven Quick Start Guide].  

=== Update Maven settings

The `settings.xml` file is a repository for customizing Maven’s global operational parameters, distinguishing itself from the `pom.xml` by its non-association with particular projects.

This file includes configurations such as the location of the local repository, alternative sources for remote repositories, inputting credentials, among others.

There are two directories for the storage of the settings.xml file:

- Maven Installation Directory: Found at ${Maven.home}/conf/settings.xml, this location reflects the settings applied universally across all Maven projects on the system.
- User-Specific Configuration: Located at ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml, this directory allows for the storage of user-specific Maven settings.

Users can tailor their Maven environment to better suit their development needs by using these configurations.

[NOTE]
====
The first `settings.xml` is also referred to as `global settings`, and the second is referenced as user settings.
Both are combined with users taking precedence.
====

[TIP] 
====
If you need to create user-specific settings from scratch, it's easiest to copy the global settings from your Maven installation to your *_${user.home}/.m2_* directory.
Maven's default *_settings.xml_* is a template with comments and examples so you can quickly tweak it to match your needs.
_If you are looking to learn more about how to manage your various Maven settings, please visit the https://maven.apache.org/settings.html[Maven Settings Reference]._
====

{PRODUCT_LONG} v{VERSION_80} product dependencies are hosted by {RH_MAVEN_URL_BASE}[Red Hat's Maven repository], so you need to ensure that your `settings.xml` reflects that, as seen in the following example:

include::../partials/settings-redhat-maven.adoc[]

=== Update to use the Maven Bill of Materials (BOM)

A bill of materials (BOM) is a list of the parts or components that are required to build a product.
BOMs are ordinary `pom.xml` files — they contain no source code and their only purpose is to declare their bundled modules.

.Always use the Maven Bill-of-Materials (BOM)
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is highly recommended to use a bill of materials (BOM) to manage project dependencies, as it simplifies dependency management by organizing a group of dependencies under a single version. 
====

A bill of materials (BOM) can be added to an existing POM file by adding it to the **_dependencyManagement_** section as a dependency with a pom type:

include::../partials/maven-bom-now.adoc[]

When a bill of materials (BOM) is used, it is not necessary to specify the dependency's version, as that appears from the BOM, so your dependencies end up like the following:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
        <artifactId>drools-compiler</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

[NOTE]
====
If, during the course of your Maven dependency update, you encounter any dependencies that are *not* included in the bill of materials (BOM), then use the Maven Library Version noted in the table below, such as:
====

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
        <artifactId>drools-compiler</artifactId>
        <version>VERSION</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

== Product Version Mapping

{PRODUCT_LONG} v{VERSION_80} is based on the former Red Hat 7.13.x offering:

include::../partials/version-mapping-now.adoc[]

== Step 3: Update tooling & runtime

Automated update tools are often provided with both patch updates and new minor versions of {PRODUCT} to facilitate updating certain components of {PRODUCT}, such as Decision/Business Central, KIE Server, and the headless controller.
Other {PRODUCT} artifacts, such as the decision engine and standalone Decision/Business Central, are released as new artifacts with each minor release and you must reinstall them to apply the update.

[NOTE]
====
You can deploy the latest version of {PRODUCT} as either a new installation or as a patch update from one of the previous {PRODUCT} patch releases.
====

You can use the same automated update tool to apply both patch updates and minor release upgrades.
Patch updates of {PRODUCT} include the latest security updates and bug fixes.
Minor release upgrades will include enhancements, security updates, and bug fixes.

[NOTE]
====
Only updates for {PRODUCT} are included in the {PRODUCT} update tools.
Updates to {EAP} must be applied using {EAP} patch distributions.
For more information about Red Hat JBoss EAP patching, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.4/html/patching_and_upgrading_guide/index[{EAP} Patching and Upgrading Guide].
====

== Prerequisites

Your Decision/Business Central and KIE Server instances are not running.
Do not apply updates while you are running an instance of Decision/Business Central or KIE Server.

== Procedure

. Navigate to the {PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_PAGE}[{PRODUCT_LONG} v{VERSION_80} Downloads Page] and follow the instructions to download the {PRODUCT} **Update Tool**.

+ 
If you are upgrading to a new minor release of {PRODUCT}, first apply the latest patch update to your current version of {PRODUCT} and then follow this procedure again to upgrade to the new minor release.

. Extract the downloaded file to a temporary directory.

+
This update tool automates the update of certain components of {PRODUCT}, such as Decision/Business Central, KIE Server, and the headless controller.
Use this update tool first to apply updates and then install any other updates or new release artifacts that are relevant to your {PRODUCT} distribution.

. If you want to preserve any files from being updated by the update tool, navigate to the extracted `bamoe-$VERSION-update` folder, open the `protectedlist.txt` file, and add the relative paths to the files that you do not want to be updated.

+
When a file is listed in the `protectedlist.txt` file, the update script does not replace the file with the new version.
A new file is created containing the same information, and a `.new` suffix is added, leaving the old file in place.
If you block files that are no longer being distributed, the update tool creates an empty marker file with a `.removed` suffix.
You can then choose to retain, merge, or delete these new files manually.

+ 
Example files to be excluded in `protectedlist.txt` file:

+ 
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
WEB-INF/web.xml  // Custom file
styles/base.css  // Obsolete custom file kept for record
----

+
The contents of the blocked file directories after the update:

+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ls WEB-INF
web.xml web.xml.new

$ ls styles
base.css base.css.removed
----

. In your command terminal, navigate to the temporary directory where you extracted the `bamoe-$VERSION-update.zip` file and run the _apply-updates_ script in the following format:

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that your Decision/Business Central and KIE Server instances are not running before you apply updates.
Do not apply updates while you are running an instance of Decision/Business Central or KIE Server.
====

+
On Linux or Unix-based systems:

+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./apply-updates.sh $DISTRO_PATH $DISTRO_TYPE
----

+
On Windows:

+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ .\apply-updates.bat $DISTRO_PATH $DISTRO_TYPE
----

+
The `$DISTRO_PATH` portion is the path to the relevant distribution directory and the `$DISTRO_TYPE` portion is the type of distribution that you are updating with this update.
The following distribution types are supported in {PRODUCT} update tool:

+

.Distribution types for {PRODUCT} v{VERSION_80}
|===
| Archive | Description

| bamoe-8.0-BC7   
| Updates Business Central (`business-central.war`)

| bamoe-8.0-KS8
| Updates KIE Server (`kie-server.war`)

| bamoe-kie-server-jws
| Updates KIE Server on Red Hat JBoss Web Server (`kie-server.war`)

| bamoe-controller-ee7
| Updates the headless controller (`controller.war`)

| bamoe-controller-jws
| Updates the headless controller on Red Hat JBoss Web Server (`controller.war`)
|===

+
Example update to Decision/Business Central and KIE Server for a full {PRODUCT} distribution on {EAP}:

+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./apply-updates.sh ~EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments/business-central.war bamoe-8.0-BC7
$ ./apply-updates.sh ~EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments/kie-server.war IBAMOE-8.0-KS8
----

+
Example update to headless IBM Business Automation Manager controller, if used:

+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./apply-updates.sh ~EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments/controller.war bamoe-controller-ee7
----

+ 
The update script creates a backup folder in the extracted `bamoe-$VERSION-update` folder with a copy of the specified distribution, and then proceeds with the update.

. After the update tool completes, return to the {PRODUCT_SUPPORT_PAGE}[IBM Support] page where you downloaded the update tool and install any other updates or new release artifacts that are relevant to your {PRODUCT} distribution.

+
For files that already exist in your {PRODUCT} distribution, such as .`jar` files for the decision engine or other add-ons, replace the existing version of the file with the new version from the {PRODUCT_SUPPORT_PAGE}[IBM Support] page.

. If you use the standalone {PRODUCT_LONG} v{VERSION_80} - Maven Repository artifact (`bamoe-{VERSION_8_LATEST}-maven-repository.zip`), such as in air-gap environments, download{PRODUCT_LONG} v{VERSION_80} - Maven Repository and extract the downloaded `bamoe-{VERSION_8_LATEST}-maven-repository.zip` file to your existing `~/maven-repository` directory to update the relevant contents.

+
Example Maven repository update:

+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
unzip -o bamoe-{VERSION_8_LATEST}-maven-repository.zip 'rhba-8.0.2.GA-maven-repository/maven-repository/*' -d /tmp/rhbaMavenRepoUpdate

$ mv /tmp/rhbaMavenRepoUpdate/rhba-8.0.2.GA-maven-repository/maven-repository/ $REPO_PATH/
----

+
[TIP]
====
You can remove the `/tmp/rhbaMavenRepoUpdate` folder after you complete the update.
====

. **Optional**: If you are changing {PRODUCT} from using property-based user storage to file-based user storage, complete the following steps:

+
.Navigate to the `$JBOSS_HOME` directory and run one of the following commands:

+
On Linux or Unix-based systems:

+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./bin/standalone.sh --admin-only -c standalone-full.xml
$ ./bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=bamoe-$VERSION-update/elytron/add-kie-fs-realm.cli
----

+
On Windows:

+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./bin/standalone.bat --admin-only -c standalone-full.xml
$ ./bin/jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=bamoe-$VERSION-update/elytron/add-kie-fs-realm.cli
----

+
.Run the following command:

+
On Linux or Unix-based systems:

+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./bin/elytron-tool.sh filesystem-realm --users-file standalone/configuration/application-users.properties --roles-file standalone/configuration/application-roles.properties --output-location standalone/configuration/kie-fs-realm-users --filesystem-realm-name kie-fs-realm-users
----

+
On Windows:

+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./bin/elytron-tool.bat filesystem-realm --users-file standalone/configuration/application-users.properties --roles-file standalone/configuration/application-roles.properties --output-location standalone/configuration/kie-fs-realm-users --filesystem-realm-name kie-fs-realm-users
----

+
Navigate to the directory where you extracted the bamoe-$VERSION-update.zip file and run one of the following commands to apply the kie-fs-realm patch:

+
On Linux or Unix-based systems:

+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./elytron/kie-fs-realm-patch.sh ~/$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/kie-fs-realm-users/
----

+
On Windows:

+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./elytron/kie-fs-realm-patch.bat ~/$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/kie-fs-realm-users/
----

. After you finish applying all relevant updates, start Decision/Business Central and KIE Server and login.
. Verify that all project data is present and accurate in Decision/Business Central, and in the top-right corner of the Decision/Business Central window, click your profile name and click About to verify the updated product version number.

+

If you encounter errors or notice any missing data in Decision/Business Central, you can restore the contents in the backup folder within the `bamoe-$VERSION-update` folder to revert the update tool changes.
You can also reinstall the relevant release artifacts from your previous version of {PRODUCT}.
After restoring your previous distribution, you can try again to run the update.

== Step 4: Update Persistence

For applications based on {RH_PAM}, you may be required to update the runtime database.
For migrating the database, the easiest way is to do it in sequence, as most of the jobs are *very* small (re: 2-4 lines of SQL).
They are all mapped by the version progression, so it will be fairly quick.
So, for instance, if we're running a PostgreSQL database, what we would need to do is the following:

. Connect to your database instance using your method of preference
. Apply the SQL scripts appropriate for the version you are migrating from up to RHPAM 7.13.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
...
$ psql -h $dbhost -U $user < rhpam-7.13-to-7.13.1.sql
$ psql -h $dbhost -U $user < rhpam-7.13.1-to-7.13.2.sql
$ psql -h $dbhost -U $user < rhpam-7.13.2-to-7.13.3.sql
...
----

[NOTE]
====
{PRODUCT_SHORT} {VERSION_80}'s database is compatible with {RH_PAM} 7.13, so all you need to do is update the database to that level, and you will be set to migrate the rest of your application.
====

Once you have executed these SQL statements, your datasource is now up to date.
If you are running a different database than PostgreSQL, replace the `psql` command with your appropriate database and tooling of choice; the files should largely be the same.
